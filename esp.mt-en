There are two types of radius dimensions : 
Changing the locations of the features with the Properties window
When an arc is dimensioned ,  the radius or diametric dimension does not have to be positioned along the arc directly .  
The DIMSE1 system variable controls whether or not a radius or diametric dimension will be drawn with an extension line when it is positioned off the end of an arc .  
When the extension line is suppressed  ( off )  ,  the dimension line of the radius or diametric dimension is drawn through the center point of the arc instead of to the extension line . 
About Creating Radius Dimensions
For horizontal dimension text ,  if the angle of the radius dimension line is greater than 15 degrees from horizontal ,  a hook line ,  also called a  { 1 } dogleg { 2 }  or  { 3 } landing { 4 }  ,  one arrowhead long ,  is created next to the dimension text . 
Radius dimensions measure the radii and diameters of arcs and circles with optional centerlines or a center mark . 
Each server that you add needs to be on a separate line in the text file .

At the prompt ,  hold down Shift ,  right-click in the drawing area ,  and choose an object snap from the Object Snap menu .  
The following is a handy reference that indicates the ones that are commonly used . 
The object snap markers might be rotated depending on the angle of the geometry . 
At any prompt for a point ,  you can specify a single object snap that overrides any other object snap settings .  
For example ,  you might need to find the clearance between two points as shown in the illustration ,  which might represent the corner of a wall and a small table ,  or perhaps a 2D section of an aluminum extrusion and a cable . 
For example ,  you will probably find it useful to turn off some of the default object snaps such as Node ,  Apparent intersection ,  and Parallel . 
In this example ,  the Command window reports a decimal distance of 2 . 1623 .  The number of decimal places and unit style displayed in the result is controlled by the UNITS command .

Notice that the  { 1 } non-continuous { 2 }   ( dashed )  linetypes come in several preset sizes . 
For quick access to the most common properties ,  use the Properties panel on the Home tab .  
For example ,  if no objects are selected ,  you can change the color that will be used for all new objects . 
Selecting objects is covered in more detail in "Modifying . "
As with other applications ,  you first select the source object ,  and then the objects to be modified . 
Enter MA in the Command window or click the Match Properties tool . 
Follow these steps to access more linetypes : 
If you click on an object in your drawing to select it ,  here is what you might see in the Properties palette . 
In the example above ,  the objects that were created on the 20 ELECTRICAL layer are purple because that is the default color of the objects on that layer . 
Organize your drawing by assigning properties such as color and linetype to objects . 
You can change any of these properties by clicking and changing its setting .  
A fast way to copy the properties of a selected object to other objects is to use the MATCHPROP command .  
You can change these preset sizes by clicking Show Details and specifying a different "global scale factor" for all linetypes—the larger the value ,  the longer the dashes and spaces . 
Also on the Properties panel is the Match Properties tool . 
For example ,  you can use the Properties palette to set your current color from ByLayer to Red .  
As a result ,  all objects that you create from then on will be red regardless of their layer . 
Sometimes these are called "property overrides . " 
The Properties palette lets you set specific properties for objects .  
When you set the range to fixed values ,  specify the maximum and minimum values to use to apply colors to points in the point cloud . 
To change a color ,  click a section of the Color Ramp and choose a new color from the Select Color dialog box .  
Edit the color ramp and/or minimum/maximum range as needed : 
Change the minimum/maximum range of values to which the color ramp is applied . 
If no classification exists ,  scan colors are used . 
The color ramp must contain at least two entries--even if they are the same color . 
To change the color scheme assigned to the intensity stylization for the point cloud ,  choose it from the Color Scheme drop-down menu . 
 { 1 }  This option assigns colors to points based on a color scheme mapped to intensity values with POINTCLOUDCOLORMAP . 
Assign a Color Scheme to the Point Cloud
Colorization for the intensity ,  elevation ,  and classification stylizations is based upon the color scheme you assign to the point cloud .  
To increase or decrease the number of colors in the scheme ,  select a new number from Color Intervals . 
Choose a Color Stylization for the Point Cloud
Specify whether you want the range of colors to be set automatically or enter fixed values . 
The color squares indicate the colors for the maximum and minimum values . 
 { 1 }  This option colors each point based on the classifications mapped to points with POINTCLOUDCOLORMAP .  
To save the customized color scheme under a new name ,  click New . 
Specify how visible points that are out of range for the minimum and maximum values are colored ,  or whether they are displayed . 
You may want to deselect Display as Gradient to see clear color intervals . 
Edit the color ramp or scheme . 
To rename or delete a color scheme ,  click Rename or Delete . 
 { 1 }  This stylization assigns colors to points based on their  { 2 } Z { 3 }  values according to a color scheme mapped to elevation values with POINTCLOUDCOLORMAP . 
POINTCLOUDCOLORMAP command displays the Point Cloud Color Map dialog box ,  used to define color schemes for point clouds stylized by Intensity ,  Elevation or Classification . 
At the Command prompt ,  enter SHEETSET . 
Displays a dialog to set or modify point cloud color schemes for intensity ,  elevation ,  and classification .

Additional information about layout viewports will be presented later in this guide . 
Also ,  the objects on locked layers appear faded .  
Faded layers are useful when you want to use them as a reference ,  but still want to reduce the visual noise in a drawing . 
Any drawing that contains at least one dimension object automatically includes a reserved layer named Defpoints .  
Layer 0 is the default layer that exists in all drawings and has some special properties .

To display these property settings in the CUI editor ,  click the Drafting & Annotation workspace in the Customizations in All Files pane ,  Tool Palette in the Workspace Contents pane ,  and then look at the settings in the Properties pane . 
Specifies the width of the palette is when it is floating . 
Specifies the height of the palette is when it is floating . 
Many palettes ,  known as secondary windows ,  can be set to docked ,  anchored ,  or floating in the application window .  
Controls which tool palette group should be displayed in the Tool Palettes window the workspace is restored or set current . 
Controls the level of palette display opacity .  
In a macro ,  use a leading asterisk  ( * )  to indicate that the command in a macro should be repeated until you press Esc or use another macro that begins with  { 1 } ^C { 2 }  .  
This means that the macro will attempt to provide responses to current prompt .  
A macro defines the action that should be performed when a user interface element is used and can be as simple as a command  ( such as  { 1 } circle { 2 }  )  and include some special characters  ( such as  { 3 } ^C^C { 4 }  )  . 
 { 1 } ^C^C { 2 }  handles canceling out of most command sequences and therefore is the recommended sequence to use . 
Commands that are part of AutoCAD should be prefixed with a period character  (  .  )  .  
Once you have created a macro ,  you might want to use it several times before moving on .  
The first example starts the UCS command and presses Spacebar .  
Creates a pause for user input ;  in this example it is the center point for the circle . 
If you want to make sure the there is no command active ,  prefix your macro with the  { 1 } ^C { 2 }  command sequence .  
For example ,  the TEXT command requires you to press Enter rather than Spacebar to terminate the command and some commands require more than one space  ( or Enter )  to complete . 
You define and then assign a macro to a command by modifying a command's Macro property . 
The tree view is used to create new user interface elements .  
The Customize User Interface  ( CUI )  Editor allows you to modify many of the user interface elements that are used to start a command in the program .  
The CUI Editor is divided into two parts
Drag a command or control ,  and drop it on a user interface element to display it as a button or control when the CUIx file is saved and loaded into the program . 
The Customize tab is displayed by default and is organized into three panes :  Customizations In ,  Command List ,  and the Dynamic Display pane . 
The Dynamic Display pane displays a preview of the user interface element selected in the Customizations In pane ,  allows you to edit the image of a command selected in the Command List pane ,  and properties specific to the item selected in the Customizations In or Command List pane . 
Customizing the user interface allows you to change the placement of the tools you commonly use and add new tools that can improve your productivity .  
In this pane ,  you create and modify user interface elements such as ribbon tabs and panels ,  and Quick Access toolbars .  
Before you start customizing your own ribbon tabs and panels ,  Quick Access toolbars ,  and other user interface elements ,  you should familiarize yourself with the Customize User Interface  ( CUI )  Editor which can be opened with the CUI command .  
The drop-down list contains some special categories and not just groupings of related commands that you can select from ,  for example
For example ,  if you want a ribbon panel that contains the commands you use most often ,  you can create a new Favorites ribbon panel in the CUI Editor and add it to the Home tab for example .  
Right-click Temporary Override Keys .  
Only actions that execute a command are recorded ;  file management tasks are not recorded . 
This DIESEL expression provides a way to toggle between paper space and model space based on the current value of the CVPORT system variable .  
You can use DIESEL string expressions in customization  ( CUI )  files as an additional method of creating macros and a way to change a menu label . 
Predefined contextual tab states range in functionality ,  from when an object is selected to when a command is active .  
For example ,  when you select a hatch object the Hatch Editor ribbon tab is displayed or the Block Editor tab is displayed after opening a block in the Block Editor . 
Instead of using a workspace to control the display of a ribbon tab ,  you assign a ribbon tab to one of the predefined contextual states .  
You can use DIESEL string expressions as a way to provide responses to a command defined with AutoLISP . 
A script can be ran at startup using the /b command line switch . 
Unlike AutoLISP applications ,  you must compile an ObjectARX application with Microsoft Visual Studio before it can be loaded into AutoCAD .  
Once an ObjectARX application file has been debugged and is ready to be used by other users ,  a Release version of the ObjectARX application must be built with Microsoft Visual Studio . 
Debugging of an ObjectARX application can be done with the from Microsoft Visual Studio when a debug version of an ObjectARX application is loaded into AutoCAD . 
ObjectARX applications require knowledge of C++ and Microsoft Visual Studio .  
VBA is no longer installed with AutoCAD .  
Microsoft { 1 }  Visual Basic { 2 }  for Applications  ( VBA )  software provides application integration with other VBA-enabled applications .  
VBA projects are stored in a separate files with the  { 1 }  . dvb { 2 }  extension ,  and are composed of code and class modules ,  and forms .  
The item is highlighted in the editor .

Autodesk provides the  { 1 } acad2014 . lsp { 2 }  file ,  which contains required ,  release-specific AutoLISP-defined functions .  
For example ,  the default customization file ,   { 1 } acad . cuix { 2 }  ,  relies on the file  { 3 } acad . mnl { 4 }  which defines numerous AutoLISP functions used by the menu .  
Additional AutoLISP  ( LSP )  files can be loaded with a CUIx file by adding a reference to the file under the LISP Files node displayed for a loaded CUIx file in the Customize User Interface  ( CUI )  Editor . 
Hatch patterns can contain dashed-lines by appending dash-length items to the end of the line definition item . 
The copied toolbar is placed under the Ribbons  { 1 }  Panels node .

In non-LT products ,  use the AutoLISP expression  { 1 }  ( setenv “MaxHatch” “n” )  { 2 }  where n is a valid number . 
Use any HTML editor or text editor to customize any of the four default Publish to Web templates : 
At the Command prompt ,  enter AI_EDITCUSTFILE . 
Windows and Mac
In addition to accessing commands from the Command prompt and user interface ,  the program provides application programming interfaces  ( APIs )  that you can use to control drawings and modify the drawing database . 
You can also manage recorded action files with the Action Macro Manager or file system directly outside the product . 
After an action macro is recorded ,  you can change the recorded actions and values from the Action tree of the Action Recorder .  
Action macro files found in or added to the paths defined by the system variables ACTRECPATH and ACTPATH are loaded automatically .  
Setting all points relative to the first point selected during playback
You use the Action Recorder to record commands and input as an action macro file with the file extension ACTM . 
The PICKFIRST and DBLCLKEDIT system variables both need to be set to 1 in order to use double-click editing . 
To add a command to a ribbon panel for example ,  expand the Ribbon and Ribbon Panels node in the Customizations In  { 1 } <file name> { 2 }  pane ,  and then the ribbon panel node before you drag the command under the ribbon panel . 
When I double-click an object ,  why does nothing happening?
To resolve this problem ,  you need to set the workspace current . 
Based on which you were previously using ,  your menu customization data might have been stored in a MNS/MNU ,  CUI ,  or CUIx file .  
Verify that all necessary CUIx files are loaded and the alias assigned to the flyout matches the toolbar in the CUIx file . 
The message box is displayed when a toolbar that is being referenced as toolbar flyout cannot found .  
The referenced toolbar was removed from the CUIx file or the alias assigned to the toolbar was changed . 
This happens because of the way toolbars are loaded at startup when a combination of main ,  enterprise ,  and partial CUIx files are used .  
Locate the missing images using Windows or File Explorer ,  and copy them to the location defined under the Customization Files  { 1 }  Custom Icon Location node on the Files tab of the Options dialog box .  
In the Properties pane ,  review the value of the Source Toolbar property .  
No commands have been assigned to the toolbar that it is referenced . 
Why is my menu not displayed on the menu bar?
Specifies the tag that uniquely identifies a command . 
Specifies the string that displays as the initial name for the item that is created in the user interface or as part of a tooltip . 
Then ,  if you make changes to the command ,  it is reflected everywhere that the command is referenced within the CUIx file . 
When a command is added to the user interface ,  a reference to the command is created .  
Specifies the macro that will execute when the command is invoked from the user interface . 
Specifies the string that displays as part of the basic tooltip for the command . 
The value of the MODEMACRO system variable determines what is displayed in the mode section ,  leftmost side ,  of the status bar .  
It doesn't change until the value of the MODEMACRO system variable is updated .

Repeats a command until another command is started or the current command is terminated . 
Macros support the use of special characters to represent macro the pressing of a physical key on the keyboard or to pause for user input . 
 ( Windows only ) 
For example ,  the backslash  (  { 1 } \ { 2 }  )  in the following macro pauses for user input and the semicolon  (  { 3 }  ;  { 4 }  )  represents a press of the Enter key . 
For example ,   { 1 } *HOT_WATER_SUPPLY { 2 } 
For example ,   { 1 } A ,  . 5 , - . 2 , ["HW" , STANDARD , S= . 1 , U=0 . 0 , X=-0 . 1 , Y=- . 05] , - . 2 { 2 } 
For example ,   { 1 } *HOT_WATER_SUPPLY , ---- HW ---- HW ---- HW ---- HW ---- HW ---- { 2 }

You cannot use command aliases in command scripts ,  and they are not recommended for use in menu macros . 
Only partial CUIx files that are loaded with the main CUIx file and the main CUI file itself can be edited with in the Customize User Interface  ( CUI )  Editor .  
Loading and using a partial CUIx file allows you to create and modify most user interface elements  ( ribbon panels and tabs ,  Quick Access toolbar ,  and so on )  in a separate CUIx file without changing the customization in the main CUIx file . 
In the Customizations In  { 1 } <file name> { 2 }  pane ,  locate and select a command . 
Right-click a user interface element ,  like a ribbon panel or Quick Access toolbar ,  and choose Paste .

When signed in to Autodesk 360 ,  you can turn on a map from an online mapping service ,  which displays as an underlay in the current viewport . 
It can be displayed only if the drawing file contains geographic location information ,  and position sensing features are enabled on your system . 
The blue circle around the indicator grows or shrinks to indicate how reliably it can determine your location . 
If a task dialog box displays ,  close it by clicking any button . 
You can insert geographic location data to a drawing file by importing the latitude and longitude of a reference point from a * . kmz or * . kml file . 
Hence ,  the GEOGRAPHICLOCATION command prompts you for the drawing scale at the time you insert geographic location data to the drawing file . 
The online map is designed to use the World Mercator coordinate system .  
As such they lend themselves very well to map geographic locations to UCS/WCS ,  and vice versa . 
Projected Coordinate Systems use a mathematical transformation to convert geographic coordinate systems into a flat two dimensional representation .  
The GIS coordinate system the system assigns by default is World Mercator .  
Local coordinate systems are considered more accurate because they align more closely with the Earth's surface in that locality ,  in comparison to an earth centric datum .  
If required ,  you can assign a different GIS coordinate system to the drawing file . 
If you assign a different GIS coordinate system to the drawing file the online map may appear skewed . 
If your system is equipped with position sensors ,  they can indicate your current location in model space . 
If you have changed the default GIS coordinate system assigned to your drawing ,  the map may appear skewed . 
The map is available only if you are signed in to Autodesk 360 .  
Furthermore ,  this command works only if the drawing file contains geographic location information and you have not disabled the online mapping service .

If the Geolocation Online Map task dialog box displays : 
You must be signed in to Autodesk 360 to use the online mapping service . 
When you do so ,  the system does not connect to the mapping service and the Geographic Location dialog box and model space behave as though you are not connected to the Internet . 
However ,  the map does not plot . 
It covers the extent of the GIS coordinate system assigned to the drawing file . 
The online map also displays in the Geographic Location dialog box to assist you pick a reference point for the geographic marker  ( geo marker )  .  
The map uses the geographic location data in your drawing file and displays behind all other drawing objects in the viewport .  
The map can assist you add context to the drawing and provide information about the surroundings of the area you are interested in .  
You can display the map as a series of satellite images  ( aerial style map )  or as a series of vector images  ( road style map )  .  
When you are signed in to Autodesk 360 ,  you can display a map from an online mapping service ,  in a viewport . 
If the map causes performance to suffer ,  or you want to limit the amount of data downloaded to your computer ,  you can choose not to use maps .  
If a task dialog box displays ,  close it by clicking any button . 
Click Yes to confirm the removal of geographic location data . 
When you remove geographical location data from a drawing file ,  all information that depend on it  ( for example ,  GIS coordinate system ,  online map )  is also removed .

The program prevents you from exploding position markers as long as the drawing file contains geographic location data . 
We recommend that you use keywords in the multiline text to make it easier to search for position markers with the FIND command . 
However if you use the 2D Wireframe visual style ,  the yellow indicator does not display .  
Position markers are annotations you place in model space to mark and label a geographical location . 
If you remove geographic location data from the drawing file ,  the tooltip also goes away . 
Import files that contain geographic location data and expect them to position themselves automatically . 
Insert a map from an online mapping service in a viewport . 
The program can derive the geographic location of all other points in the drawing file from this information . 
You can remove geographic location data from a drawing file using the GEOREMOVE command .  
The program captures the geographic location  ( latitude and longitude )  of this reference point and the direction of the north .  
After you insert geographic location data to a drawing file ,  any point in that drawing file corresponds to an actual location on the surface of the Earth . 
The latitude and longitude values of a location can differ from one GIS coordinate system to another .  
Hence ,  when you specify the geographic location of the geo marker ,  the system also captures the details of the GIS coordinate system that you based the latitude and longitude values on . 
The geo marker and GIS coordinate system are both removed from the drawing file .  
The geo marker points to a reference point in model space that corresponds to a known geographical location .  
After you insert a geo marker in a drawing ,  you can : 
Geographic location data in a drawing file is built around an entity known as the geographic marker  ( geo marker )  .  
You can delete a reply if you are its originator .

In drawings containing geographic location data ,  the My Location indicator shows your approximate position .  
Windows 8 goes further and can determine the position of a system using software services as well .  
If you are using Windows XP ,  you cannot show your position in a drawing . 
In administrator settings ,  enable the Windows Location platform  ( This is ON by default ) 
If your position cannot be determined accurately a blue circle is displayed around the My Location indicator .  
Your position could be anywhere within this circle .  
For example ,  Wi-Fi triangulation and IP address resolution technologies . 
The online mapping service is provided as part of the Autodesk 360 .  
Windows 7 and Windows 8 provide built-in support for location sensors such as Global Positioning System  ( GPS )  devices . 
If you are using Windows 7 ,  enable GPS sensors before you start using location services in AutoCAD .  
AutoCAD can communicate with the location services provided by Windows 7 and Windows 8 .  
The first time you attempt to display a map in a drawing session ,  the program displays the Geolocation Online Maps task dialog box .  
If you select "No maps" from this dialog box ,  the maps do not display .  
Sometimes due to heavy Internet traffic ,  communication with the online mapping service may breakdown .  
If this is the case ,  typically ,  at least one part of the map displays .  
If the task dialog box does not display ,  you most likely selected the "Always perform my current choice" option .  
Restart AutoCAD and select "Use Maps" when the task dialog box displays again .

Takeoff an entire building information model  ( BIM )  and create synchronized project views that combine information from BIM tools such as Revit® and AutoCAD® software together with geometry ,  images ,  and data from other tools .  
Your takeoff data can then be exported to Excel or XML for analysis and shared with other project team members in the cloud using Autodesk BIM 360® for optimized collaboration . 
You can also perform a virtual  ( or manual )  takeoff for items with no associated model geometry or properties . 
You can combine multiple sources of 3D  { 1 } source files { 2 }  and generate quantity takeoff .  
Each file or files you use in Quantification must have an associated project ,  which you create when you first open the Quantification Workbook in Navisworks .  
play down import catalog - not as recommended option .  
User  ( estimator )  should have catalog already in here  ( nw directory )  which would have been added by their IT engineer so would have no reason to browse . 
Either method opens the Project Setup Wizard ,  where you specify the project name and location ,  unit and currency systems ,  catalog for organizing takeoff data ,  and documents to import for creating takeoff . 
When you create a project ,  you select the design files and catalog content to import ,  and you specify project settings ,  such as measurement units .

DWF files published from earlier releases of these applications require the use of both a 3D model and the supporting 2D sheet set . 
With DWF files published from supported AutoCAD-based and Revit-based design applications  ( version 2010 or later )  ,  you can perform a model takeoff using only a 3D model .  
The items that are created by the Model Takeoff tool are placed in a takeoff group whose name is based on the model name .  
This tool ,  which can be used only with 3D DWF files ,  extracts the object tree from the model and adds it to the Takeoff palette .  
Quantities are generated for an item when both its Type and at least one dimension are defined .

Before publishing a DWF ( x )  file ,  the architect ,  engineer ,  or other designer ,  determines which features  ( model ,  layouts ,  layers ,  properties and so on )  to include in the DWF ( x )  file .  
Most DWF ( x )  files begin as drawings created in Autodesk® design applications ,  such as AutoCAD® ,  AutoCAD® Architecture ,  AutoCAD® Civil 3D ,  and Revit® .  
After determining the content ,  the designer publishes the drawing from its original format to the DWF ( x )  file format and sends the DWF ( x )  file to you .  
A typical workflow begins with a design file such as a DWF or DWFx .  
When you receive these DWF ( x )  and non-DWF ( x )  files ,  the Quantification workflow begins .

The process of measuring quantities of materials from models ,  drawings and specifications prepared by architects ,  engineers ,  and other designers is known as quantity takeoff .  
Traditionally ,  construction cost estimators have used paper-based methods to perform quantity takeoff .  
Make Material Estimates
Quantification helps you produce detailed quantity takeoff to make material estimates ,  measure areas and count building components .  
Quantification in  { 1 } Autodesk Navisworks { 2 }  gives estimators the tools to perform digital quantity takeoff ,  which is faster ,  easier ,  and more accurate than paper-based methods .

It does not apply to  { 1 } Revit Architecture { 2 }  ,   { 3 } Revit MEP { 4 }  ,   { 5 } Revit Structure { 6 }  ,  or Revit LT . 
The most common reason why hardware acceleration is unavailable is that a graphics driver cannot be located on the system .  
The following is a list of the known conditions when an error or driver failure can commonly occur : 
After starting Remote Desktop ,  hardware acceleration is disabled or unavailable .  
To use hardware acceleration ,  visit the video card manufacturer's website or the Certification website  (  { 1 } http : //www . autodesk . com/autocad-graphicscard { 2 } http : //www . autodesk . com/autocad-graphicscard { 3 }  )  to download and install the latest driver available for your hardware . 
To help ensure that hardware acceleration operates correctly ,  verify that you are running the latest service pack for the product and video graphics card driver before attempting to re-enable hardware acceleration . 
If you do not want to migrate all user profiles ,  you will need to use the Profiles tab in the Options dialog box to export each profile from the previous release and import them into the current release . 
In the Choose Which Settings are Synced dialog box ,  choose the custom settings that you want to keep synchronized when you access your Autodesk 360 account from different computer . 
Hence ,  the GEOGRAPHICLOCATION command prompts you for the drawing scale at the time you insert geographic location information to the drawing file . 
You can insert geographic location information to a drawing file by importing the latitude and longitude of a reference point from a * . kmz or * . kml file . 
The My Location indicator tracks your movement ,  and indicates your position in model space .  
You can insert geographic location information to a drawing file by specifying the location of a reference point on a map provided by an online mapping service . 
Geographic location information created by versions of AutoCAD before AutoCAD 2014 do not contain the information required to support the commands on the Geolocation tab .  
The Geolocation tab displays only after you set geographic location to a drawing file . 
It uses the geographic location information in your drawing file and displays behind all other drawing objects in the viewport .  
The online map can assist you add context to the drawing and provide information about the surroundings of the area you are interested in .  
Controls the format of the latitude and longitude values in the Geographic Location dialog box and the status bar ,  when the drawing file contains geographic location information . 
Import files that contain geographic location information and expect them to position themselves automatically . 
After you insert geographic location information to a drawing file ,  any point in that drawing file corresponds to an actual location on the surface of the Earth . 
Geographic location information in a drawing file is built around an entity known as the geographic marker  ( geo marker )  .  
Centers the map around the marker ,  and adjusts the zoom so that the area around is clearly visible . 
Windows 7 and Windows 8 provide built-in support for position sensors such as Global Positioning System  ( GPS )  devices . 
In drawings containing geographic location information ,  the My Location indicator shows your approximate position .

Locate the other half of a single relationship
Changes to assemblies during the design process can affect existing relationships causing them to conflict with others or become unsolvable .  
Find relationships in an assembly
When you constrain or connect assembly components to one another ,  you control their position .  
That is ,  the selected component and connected parts move together in their related positions . 
The part remains in the moved location but snaps back to its constrained or connected position when you apply a new relationship or update or refresh the assembly . 
Components related to the grounded component remain in their connected positions at the new location .

You can use ObjectARX libraries in conjunction with other programming interfaces ,  such as AutoLISP ,  ActiveX ,  or  . NET ,  enabling cross-API integration . 
Once an ObjectARX application file has been debugged and is ready to be used by other users ,  a release version of the ObjectARX application must be built with Microsoft Visual Studio . 
Debugging of an ObjectARX application can be performed from Microsoft Visual Studio when a debug version of an ObjectARX application is loaded into an AutoCAD-based product . 
Unlike AutoLISP applications ,  you must compile an ObjectARX application with Microsoft Visual Studio before it can be loaded into an AutoCAD-based product .  
ObjectARX { 1 } ® { 2 }   ( AutoCAD Runtime Extension )  is a compiled-language programming environment for developing applications that allow you to load and run compiled projects in the same address space as AutoCAD-based products ,  enabling your programs to operate directly with core AutoCAD data structures and code . 
The following AutoLISP routine defines the CUSTFILES command ,  which launches Windows® Explorer within Windows and opens it to the location where roamable customizable files were installed . 
Commands can also be started from a script file or by an AutoLISP ,  ObjectARX ,  or  . NET application .

You can also attach point clouds  ( ISD ,  PCG .  
and RCP files )  using this method .  
Displays a dialog box containing a map ,  if you are signed in to Autodesk 360 ,  .  
You do this by specifying the latitude and longitude of a location and marking the corresponding location in model space .  
Displays the elevation of the marked location in the units specified in the Drawing Units box .  
Picks a geographic location for a reference point in the drawing area .

When the ribbon button is highlighted , 
Click  { 1 } Point Cloud tab { 2 } Show Clipframe { 3 }  .  { 4 } 
The selected polyline is not deleted . 
Displays the point cloud with the clipping applied ,  so that the points that have been clipped are hidden . 
 { 1 }  Creates a clipping boundary that is based on a polyline that you select .  
Both formats can be attached to an AutoCAD drawing . 
You can use the K2 product to convert raw scan data to an RCS format .  
K2 can also save files in an RCP format that serves as a project file that references multiple RCS files .  
The following raw scan file formats can be indexed : 
 { 1 }  If geographic location information exists in both the current drawing and the point cloud file ,  the point cloud location is automatically set at the time of attachment . 
By default ,  the insertion point of the point cloud file is 0 , 0 , 0 unless geographic location information is available .  
You can store your customized application settings with your Autodesk 360 account . 
You can also control which custom settings are stored with your Autodesk 360 account with the ONLINESYNC command . 
Indicates whether a copies of your drawings are saved automatically to your Autodesk 360 account .

If you select "No" as the answer to "Do you want to use Autodesk Maps Service?" ,  the maps do not display .  
You can locate a position you marked by searching for keywords contained in the multilne text object of the position marker . 
If you are using a touch pad for panning and zooming ,  the Touch panel is displayed on the ribbon ,  so that you can easily cancel the current operation . 
touch panning

For those using a touch pad ,  controls the display of the Touch panel on the ribbon . 
Retains the on or off status of individual scan files at the time the RCP file was attached .  
An RCP file is a project file that contains pointers to individual scan files and displays them as a single point cloud . 
Inherits the most recent on or off status of individual scan files referenced by the attached RCP file .  
Use this setting to avoid inheriting changes made to the referenced RCP file . 
If the display status changes in the referenced RCP file ,  those changes are reflected the next time you open the drawing that contains the attachment . 
Controls whether the drawing retains the on or off status of point cloud scan files that are referenced by an attached RCP file . 
AutoCAD is able to read geographic location information in AutoCAD Map 3D files and recognize the geographic marker  ( geo marker )  and GIS coordinate system . 
If you change the default setting ,  the map may distort when the system attempts to match positions on the map to the corresponding coordinates .  
The online map is designed to work with the WGS 84 GIS coordinate system ,  which is assigned to the drawing by default .  
In cartography ,  this technique is referred to as "rubber-sheeting"  . 
After you create an Autodesk account ,  you can access extended capabilities and features : 
Saving drawings to your Autodesk account is similar to storing them on a secure ,  maintained network drive . 
You can use AutoCAD WS to view ,  edit ,  and share the drawings in your Autodesk account using popular phone and tablet devices . 
If you work both in the office and at home or at a remote facility ,  you can access the files in your Autodesk account without having to copy and transport them with a laptop or USB flash drive . 
Adjust the location of parts that branch off a pressure pipe by sliding them along the pipe . 
Pressure pipe tables can include data such as material ,  diameter ,  length ,  or any pressure pipe property . 
This command converts lines ,  arcs ,  2D and 3D polylines ,  feature lines ,  alignments ,  and survey figures into connected pressure pipes and bends . 
Use this command to change the depth of pressure network parts . 
If you have the Autodesk Infrastructure Design Suite ,  you may already have Infrastructure Modeler installed .  
Survey queries can be saved to the current survey database ,  or to a QML file ,  and then reused . 
Try it today!
Fitting tables can include data such as material ,  size ,  bend angle ,  or any fitting property . 
Appurtenance tables can include data such as type ,  material ,  size ,  or any appurtenance property .

FAQ :  Which Commands and System Variables Have Changed?
The SECURELOAD system variable controls whether AutoCAD loads executable files based on their location .  
Beginning with AutoCAD 2013 SP1 ,  the program can be restricted to load and execute files that contain code from trusted locations only ;  trusted locations are specified by the TRUSTEDPATHS system variable .  
The following outlines what needs to be done to use custom programs developed for a release of AutoCAD-based programs prior to AutoCAD Keystone : 
 { 1 } ObjectARX { 2 }  – Programs developed for AutoCAD 2013-based products do not need to be updated unless you want to take advantage of the latest changes to the API . 
Changes to the AutoCAD application programming interfaces  ( APIs )  occur with each new release ,  with major changes that might require changes to custom programs generally aligned with each drawing file format . 
 { 1 }  . NET { 2 }  – Programs developed for AutoCAD 2013-based products do not need to be updated unless you want to take advantage of the latest changes to the API . 
Be sure to test your applications using the different values of the SECURELOAD system variable .

When transitioning to the latest release ,  linetype and hatch pattern files from a previous release simply need to be copied to one of the product Support Search Paths in the latest release .

custom hatch pattern
Custom linetype and hatch pattern files are used to define new linetypes and hatch patterns that do not come with the product . 
Linetype and hatch pattern files are ASCII text files with the file extensions  . lin and  . pat respectively .  
custom linetype
These files can be edited using a simple text editor such as NotePad on Windows or TextEdit on the Mac OS . 
If you have custom linetype or hatch pattern definitions stored in other files ,  place those files in one of the support search paths already defined or add the location of your LIN/PAT files to the Files tab of the Options dialog box to use them in the latest release . 
You can use Windows Explorer to move or copy customized files between folders as needed and export and import profiles and customization  ( CUIx )  files from the previous release into the latest release instead of using the Migrate Custom Settings utility .  
However ,  using the Migrate Custom Settings utility might not be as helpful under the following conditions : 
You need to migrate a moderate-to-significant amount of customization to the user interface
Manually migrating custom settings and files can take longer ,  but it does give you the most control .  
If you use the Migrate Custom Settings utility and the results do not seem correct ,  you can use the Reset Settings to Default utility on the Windows Start menu to restore the installed default settings . 
 { 1 } Options dialog box { 2 }  – Manages the paths the product uses to locate custom files and sets custom settings .  
Many of the custom files and path locations can be set in a deployment ,  in addition to the current profile can also be specified .

Analysis assumptions adopted in the  { 1 } Structural Analysis for Revit { 2 }  application . 
To prepare  { 1 } Revit { 2 }  analytical models for analysis ,  you need to install the  { 3 } Structural Analysis for Revit { 4 }  add-in on the computer with  { 5 } Revit { 6 }  installed .  
After a model has been prepared ,  you can also submit the analysis on the  { 1 } Structural Analysis for Revit { 2 }  website  ( see :   { 3 } Using the Website { 4 }  )  . 
You can also download a  { 1 } Autodesk® Robot™ Structural Analysis Professional { 2 }  model to perform more advanced analysis of it . 
The  { 1 } Structural Analysis for Revit { 2 }  website opens by default on the Dashboard tab .  
Although the analytical model will be verified automatically before the analysis is performed ,  it is good practice to run member support and consistency checks manually before sending the model to  { 1 } Structural Analysis for Revit { 2 }   ( see  { 3 } Verifying the Analytical Model { 4 }  )  .

Viewpoint only on items that are not modeled ,  otherwise does not make sense . 
Use automatic takeoff tools to create takeoff for objects in 3D models and 2D sheets .  
Automatic takeoff tools use the design data from the publishing application to create takeoff ,  rather than measuring drawing geometry as manual takeoff tools do . 
Primary quantity drives takeoff
When you first open a file in Quantification ,  the Project Setup Wizard opens .  
Tip
It extracts the objects from the model and displays them as items in the Quantification Workbook . 
You can use measure tools in conjunction with a virtual takeoff ,  and associate a viewpoint with the virtual takeoff item . 
On the Setup Quantification :  Select Units dialog ,  select Measurement Units . 
You can create point lights ,  spot lights ,  and distant lights to achieve the effects you want .

A similar situation occurs if you change the GIS coordinate system of the host drawing or referenced drawing .  
Unlike at attach time ,  the system does not warn you of a coordinate system mismatch when you do this change .  
Because of the coordinate system mismatch ,  the points in the referenced drawing file do not transform to the coordinate system of the host drawing .  
About Issues Concerning Attaching or Inserting Drawing Files with Geographic Data
This paragraph must replace the preceding paragraph if the ECO for the warning is approved . 
Changing the coordinate system in one drawing file results in a coordinate system mismatch .  
As such they may not transform correctly and may not indicate the correct geographic locations
Change the GIS coordinate systems of both drawings ;  the host drawing and the referenced drawing in order to avoid a coordinate system mismatch . 
Hence ,  the system warns you if it detects a coordinate system mismatch at the time you attach or insert the drawing .  
Detach the referenced drawing and attach it again . 
This text must be appended to the preceding paragraph if the ECO for the warning is approved . 
The other points may not transform correctly and may indicate incorrect geographic locations . 
The AGX utility performs a series of tests against the hardware in your computer to determine if it meets or exceeds the standards required to efficiently run the AutoCAD-based product . 
You can test your hardware configuration using the Autodesk Graphics Experience  ( AGX )  utility ,   { 1 } http : //www . autodesk . com/agx { 2 } http : //www . autodesk . com/agx { 3 }  ,  and determine what hardware improvements you might want to make based on your needs .  
It is not possible to test all combinations of hardware that can go into a computer ,  if your hardware is not listed ,  it does not mean it cannot run the latest release of an AutoCAD-based product .  
In the drawing area ,  select the position marker to resize .

The availability of the Angular or Linear options depends on the connection type .  
To Lock or Protect a relationship : 
Each Connect type fully defines the location and motion of the selected components .  
You can select end ,  mid ,  or center point geometry to define a connection .  
For example ,  a Rotational connection supports Angular limits ,  but Linear limits are not available . 
Press the Ctrl key after the necessary component is highlighted to limit selection to the component . 
You can also set the connect relationship conditions using Lock and Protect . 
Use Connect to position components and define motion
The most common connection type is Rigid which positions a component and removes all degrees of freedom .  
Limits are not available for Rigid connections . 
If necessary ,  change the connection type . 
Use Connect to define and manage relationships
Lock or Protect a connection
Automatic determines the connection type based on the following rules : 
Open the dialog box and click the Limits tab . 
Connections locked in the Assembly environment are also locked in Dynamic Simulation .  
Creating a connection fully defines the component location and motion in one step .  
Connect
Created connections are automatically converted to joints when you enter the Dynamic Simulation environment .  
A shaft in a tube is an example of a cylindrical connection . 
The following describes the connection types and how they operate while positioning a component : 
In previous versions of Inventor ,  construction lines and center lines are automatically selected ,  and frame components are created from them . 
For connections that have one or more degrees of freedom ,  two options are available on the browser context menu : 
To place a component on a planar face ,  use this connection type .  
Welded and bolted connections are examples of a rigid connection . 
Hinges and rotating levers are examples of a rotational connection . 
The geometry you select determines the default connection type ,  or you can specify a connection type . 
 { 1 } Inventor connection { 2 } 
With the addition of the connect command ,  both constraints and connections are now described as relationships . 
The first component placed in an assembly is no longer grounded .  
You can use connections with constraints to position components and describe motion . 
A slide block moving along a track is an example of a slider connection . 
In the following image ,  the Ball connection is locked . 
The Connect command is a simple way to position components and describe motion .  
A ball and socket are an example of a ball connection .

Quantification takes the properties from the original publishing application ,  such as AutoCAD or Revit ,  and creates takeoff items in the workbook . 
The sun and sky lights are not included but you can adjust the sun and the sky properties on the  { 1 } Environments { 2 }  tab . 
If the light is a target point light ,  spot light ,  or web light additional target point properties are available . 
You can render directly in the  { 1 } Scene View { 2 }  by clicking the  { 3 } Ray Trace { 4 }  button on the  { 5 } Render { 6 }  tab on the ribbon . 
Rendering a Scene with Interactive Ray Trace
In Quantification ,  the primary quantity drives the takeoff rather than measuring drawing geometry as manual takeoff tools do . 
If this check box is clear ,  the sky will be black . 
Customize render settings . 
Once you have set up the scene with Autodesk Graphics ,  you can view the materials and lights in  { 1 } Autodesk Navisworks { 2 }  in real time . 
You can define and apply your materials and lights directly to a model and save the as an NWD or NWF file .

This video provides a { 1 }  { 2 } n overview of reports in AutoCAD Electrical . 
Reports are created from the project’s drawings and external files such as the catalog database . 
There are schematic reports and panel reports . 
Panel reports include a Panel Bill of Materials ,  Panel component list and more . 
Schematic reports include a Schematic { 1 }   { 2 } Bill of Materials ,  Schematic Component list ,  Wire From/To ,  { 3 }   { 4 } and more . 
To create any report ,  select the type of report , …and the report options . 
Report options vary by report type ,  and can include the type of components ,  display options ,  and Installation or Location filters . 
The report displays allowing you to customize the format and output the report . 
You can change the fields to include in the report ,  the field order ,  and the field names . 
A report can be inserted as a table . 
You can customize the table format to match your company’s requirements . 
The report table can be split into multiple table objects and across multiple drawings…
…and you can save { 1 }   { 2 } the report to a spreadsheet ,  database ,  or a text file . 
If you’ve added custom attributes to your components ,  add them to the User-defined Attributes List . 
These attributes can then be added to the reports . 
Use Automatic Reports to create and output a group of reports . 
Select the reports you want to run . 
For each report ,  select an existing format file with the output already defined ,  or …create a format file defining the output you want .

Once you have selected the format files ,  run Automatic Reports to insert the report tables ,  and create the output files . 
This video covered some of the functionality for creating reports . 
This video provides an overview of creating a panel lay { 1 }  { 2 } out in AutoCAD Electrical . 
You can insert panel  { 1 } foot { 2 } prints from the panel icon menu . 
There are different ways for you to do this . 
You can enter a catalog value to find the matching footprint ,  
draw the symbol ,  and more . 
You can insert panel footprints from a list of schematic components . 
An “x” indicates the schematic component has  { 1 } already { 2 }  been inserted in a panel layout . 
You can insert panel footprints individually ,  or select multiple footprints to insert at the same time . 
You can change the insertion order as needed . 
Panel footprints receive all their information from the schematic component . 
The matching Tag value creates the relationship between a panel component and its schematic representation . 
Item numbers are assigned based on the catalog value . 
Components with the same catalog value receive the same item number . 
If the catalog value is changed ,  the footprint updates automatically . 
The item number of a component is displayed in a balloon . 
Other panel layout commands you can use include :   …the panel configuration command that lets you define the first item number ,  balloon type ,  and more
The  { 1 } Balloon { 2 }  command ,  which lets you add balloons to the panel drawing . 
You can  { 1 } Resequence  { 2 } all the { 3 }  Item Numbers { 4 }  in a project . 
 { 1 } …a { 2 } nd you can create Panel  { 3 } Reports { 4 }  like a Panel Bill of Materials ,  a Panel Component report ,  and more . 
You can output reports to a file such as a spreadsheet or database file ,  or  .  .  . 
You can insert a report on the drawing as a table . 
This video covered some of the functionality for creating a panel layout . 
See the AutoCAD Electrical help for more information . 
This video demonstrates some tools you can use to make changes across multiple drawings in a project . 
You can add or update wire numbers on selected wires ,  
wires on the current drawing ,  
or wires in the project . 
When a ladder’s reference numbers change ,  the existing component tags do not update . 
Use the Retag command to update component tags and all the related components in the project . 
Use the Update Signal References command to update the source and destination signals . 
When you need to substitute one symbol for another ,  use the Swap Block command to update blocks in a project . 
You can also update blocks project-wide when library symbols are modified . 
This is useful when you add a drawing in the middle of a project . 
The Project-wide utilities command operates on wire numbers ,  component tags ,  attribute text ,  wire types ,  and item numbers .  
Use the Mark and Verify command to keep track of changes made to drawings ,  even if the changes are made outside of AutoCAD Electrical . 
Mark the drawings first ,  later use the Verify option to generate a  { 1 }   { 2 } 
You can find and replace component values on the active drawing or across the project drawing set . 
Export drawing information to a spreadsheet .  
Edit component tags ,  catalog assignments ,  wire numbers ,  PLC I/O descriptions and more in the spreadsheet  ,  and then apply your edits to the drawings in the project . 
Detect potential problems like duplicated tags or terminals , 
contacts with { 1 }  { 2 } out parents ,  pin number issues ,  and more with Electrical Audit .

Use limits on constraints or connections to define the range of allowable movement or rotation . 
To warn if added relationships violate the required motion ,  use Protect on a connection . 
You can use connections with constraints to obtain the required results . 
You can also select a connection type and then select the objects to position and connect .  
Assembly connect
To help you position components correctly ,  the connection previews the effects before it is applied . 
Connect can automatically determine the connection type based on origin selections .  
You can use  { 1 } Lock  { 2 } and  { 3 } Protect { 4 }  controls with connect .  
The  { 1 } Connect { 2 }  command reduces the complexity of component relationships .  
Notice that Rigid is the most common connection type and only the two bearings rotate .  
Assembly constraints and assembly connections both create relationships that determine component placement and allowable movement . 
Use connect to position a component and fully define the motion .  
In the following image ,  two assembly connection types ,  Rigid and Rotational ,  are used to locate the components and define degrees of freedom .  
Connect command
You can use constraints with connections to obtain the required results . 
Constrain and Connect both support limits .  
Because Connect explicitly defines the component location and degrees of freedom ,  fewer connections are required to provide consistent and predictable results .

Define simple envelopes to replace complex ones . 
Click Include components and specify components included in the simplified version . 
Level of complexity is not required by downstream processes or other in-house or external disciplines . 
Inventor Simplify tools reduce model complexity for easier and faster referencing throughout your design process . 
Some reasons for simplifying a model are : 
The tools make generating a simplified view presentation easy and straightforward . 
Removal of intellectual property so the model can be shared with clients . 
Combine the parts into one simplified part . 
At times you do not need the explicit detail provided by part models for an assembly .  
Specific steps and detailed explanations are provided in the associated topics . 
Instead ,  a simple representation of the assembly with only critical information ,  such as mounting points ,  is all that is required .

Reactive molding  ( 3Donly ) 
Conformal cooling channels must first be modeled within a CAD package and then imported into the study . 
Dual Domain - using the Cool  ( FEM )  solution . 
Conformal cooling analyses are supported for parts using the following mesh types . 
Transient cool analyses are used to simulate the change in mold temperature with time . 
Microchip encapsulation  ( 3D only ) 
Instead of using the traditional tube-like cooling systems ,  molds can be manufactured with complex cooling shapes and cross-sections that closely follow the contours of the part . 
Thermoplastics injection molding  ( Dual Domain and 3D ) 
The targeted removal of heat from a part can be achieved using conformal cooling .  
Conformal cooling - for analysing complex shaped cooling systems
Transient cool - for analyzing temperature distributions in the mold
3D - using the Cool  ( FEM )  solution . 
For a midplane or dual domain model ,  you need to assign the "Gate" property to gate element ( s )  in order to have the correct  { 1 } Grow from { 2 }  result generated . 
Filling profiles may be required to obtain satisfactory temperature distribution during the filling phase .

All three types can be started from the same template ,  but if you start a sheet metal part from the sheet metal template ,  the Sheet Metal environment  and menus are active when you begin . 
Features that begin with a sketch ,  such as Extrude and Revolve ,  are called sketched features . 
In this example ,  I am going to complete the 2D sketch and then use the extrude command to thicken the guitar body . 
You can use the manipulator arrow or enter a precise value to set the thickness . 
A second sketch is extruded with the cut option to remove material for the guitar neck . 
To make changes to a feature ,  locate it in the browser and then double-click or right-click and select Edit Feature . 
The browser history reveals that extrusions using the cut option were the primary feature used to shape this guitar body . 
Use the sheet metal part template to create a uniform thickness part that can be unfolded . 
The first feature in a sheet metal part begins with a 2D sketch . 
Use the Face command to thicken the first profile . 
Sheet metal specific commands automate the task of designing features like flanges . 
You can also create a 2d sketch and use the Face command to create a flange . 
And then use Create Flat Pattern to view the unfolded model . 
Add the required details such as slots and holes 
Double-click the Folded Model in the browser to exit the flat pattern . 
A  { 1 } multi-body part { 2 }  is a top-down workflow that captures the design of multiple components in a single part file .

The AMG matrix solver is faster but requires more memory compared to the legacy solver . 
Add more resources  ( memory ,  swap swap space )  to your machine . 
Running a Fill+Pack analysis on a model with a large number of elements may exceed the memory limit . 
Running a 3D Warp analysis may exceed the memory limit . 
This option is on by default .  
This increases analysis time and memory requirement but improves accuracy for true 3D parts . 
This option is on by default . 
Review the mesh density in the part and on cooling circuits ,  and remesh using a coarser mesh if possible . 
In particular ,  3D results require greater amounts of memory . 
For a 3D model only ,  turn off the AMG matrix solver .  
Consider using the  { 1 } Optimize memory for results display { 2 }  options in the results preferences  (  { 3 } Application button  { 4 }  Application menu { 5 } Options { 6 } Results { 7 }  tab )  to minimize the amount of memory required to display results . 
Post-processing large result files may exceed the memory limit .  
Running a Cool analysis on a model with a large number of elements may exceed the memory limit . 
This option is set to  { 1 } Auto { 2 }  by default . 
Turning this option off enables the legacy  ( SSORCG )  matrix solver .  
If the part geometry is thick or solid  ( true 3D geometry )  ,  using mesh aggregation is not recommended .  
Make sure the  { 1 } Use mesh aggregation and 2nd-order tetrahedral elements { 2 }  option is selected on the Warp Settings page of the Process Settings Wizard .  
Change the  { 1 } AMG matrix solver selection { 2 }  option setting to  { 3 } Off { 4 }  in the  { 5 } Solver Parameters { 6 }  dialog .  
The maximum model size on which a 3D Warp analysis can be run on a 32-bit operating system is up to 1 . 5 million elements  ( using legacy solver and mesh aggregation options )  . 
Try remeshing the model using a coarser mesh to reduce the number of elements . 
Note that using a coarse mesh may affect analysis accuracy ,  in particular for 3D models . 
Enable mesh aggregation to reduce memory requirement for analyses of thin-wall parts .  
If the model contains more than 800 , 000 elements ,  change the  { 1 } Use AMG matrix solver { 2 }  option to  { 3 } No { 4 }  on the  { 5 } Warp Settings { 6 }  page of the  { 7 } Process Settings Wizard { 8 }  .  
Turning off the mesh aggregation option causes the original mesh to be used for the analysis .

Inventor View 2014 - Read Me
Due to improvements in the ownership workflow ,  when a Vault server participating in a connected workgroup is migrated to Vault 2014 the default lease time for ownership is set to 0 . 
Prior to upgrading to ADMS 2014 ,  OS formatting on the target server must be changed to match that of the originating server . 
Vault 2014 clients no longer display the ownership icon when another site has ownership of an entity but the lease has expired .  
As a result ,  Users with older Vault clients may experience errors opening ,  checking out ,  or performing other operations on files which appear to be owned locally .  
Autodesk Vault 2014 Readme
New functionality available in Vault 2014 will not be available in older Vault clients and Add-Ins . 
 { 1 } Office SharePoint { 2 } 
Vault Basic ADMS installs 32-bit SQL 2008 Express SP3 if SQL is not already installed on the system .  
Autodesk Vault 2014 installs SQL Server 2008 Express SP3 using the Network Service account for SQL services .  
When performing an upgrade from a previous release to 2014 ,  the IIS Configuration cannot be modified . 
Some functionality in a Vault 2014 client may not work when only an older version of the CAD application is installed or if an older version of the CAD application was last run .  
Change "0 : 1 : 0" to "0 : 5 : 0" . 
In order to view PDF thumbnails an iFilter must be installed on the server .  
If you are planning on using Windows authentication within Vault Professional when using Windows Server Operating Systems ,  the "Windows Authentication" service for IIS must be installed . 
Save and close the web . config file . 
 { 1 } For security reasons ,  Microsoft recommends that you do not install SQL Server 2008 on a domain controller . 
When upgrading from a previous release of Vault Server ,  it is strongly recommended that you perform a backup first . 
Running Inventor View 2014 or the 2014 version of the CAD application and then retrying the operation may resolve the issue . 
Autodesk Vault 2014 was tested on VMware ESXi version 5 . 0 and VMware Workstation version 9 . 0 . 1 { 1 }  { 2 } 
Autodesk Vault 2014 supports side-by-side client installations with Autodesk Vault 2012 and Autodesk Vault 2013 . 
Find the < add key="PropertyComplianceCheckInterval" value="0 : 1 : 0" /> entry . 
If the last run version of Inventor is older than the version of the files you are changing through the Vault client ,  then the Vault client will display an error  ( for example ,  if you last ran Inventor 2013 on your computer and then try to do a Copy Design on files last saved in Inventor 2014 the Copy Design will fail )  . 
Edit your server's web . config file . 
Find the < connectivity . settings > section . 
It is recommended that you allocate the minimum or higher system requirements when running Autodesk Vault 2014 in virtual environments .  
 { 1 }  SQL Server 2008 Express SP3 cannot be installed on a domain controller under a local service account or a network service account .  
Before installing a Vault client ,  make sure the Beta version of DWF TrueView has been removed ,  otherwise the required version of DWF TrueView cannot be installed by the Client . 
 { 1 } #REVVP { 2 } Vault for Revit Products { 3 } 
As virtual environments could cause unexpected consequences ,  Autodesk reserves the right to ask that any customer reported problems be reproduced on a physical machine outside the VMware environment .  
However ,  older Vault clients do not automatically request ownership if the other site's lease has expired as Vault 2014 clients do .

Moldflow
Designing molds and manufacturing original plastic parts is a highly complex process .  
What if you could validate your innovative ideas while optimizing your designs before you built the first prototype?
But how? 
With Autodesk Simulation Moldflow products . 
Designers ,  analysts ,  and engineers in companies worldwide use Autodesk Simulation Moldflow products to accurately predict the plastic injection molding process reducing the need for costly physical prototypes . 
Through simulation setup and results interpretation users can see how changes to materials ,  geometry ,  wall thickness and gate location can affect the manufacturability of plastic materials . 
Moldflow products are used to validate and optimize the design and layout of tools for plastic parts ,  by simulating the behavior of the plastic material during the injection molding process .  
With multi-CAD import you can evaluate designs from a variety of different CAD packages . 
Moldflow products help you identify areas that are difficult to fill ,  where visual defects are likely to occur ,  or parts that will warp excessively .  
T { 1 } hey can often help you achieve a higher production rate at a lower cost .  { 2 } 
With these impressive tools you can find the answers tovital question about your designs before beginning production . 
Questions like : 
Will the mold fill?
Will there be visual defects ,  such as sink marks ,  or weld lines?
Will the part warp?
Can the part still be molded successfully if the material is changed?
What is the required cycle time?
Can the cycle time be safely reduced?
With Autodesk Simulation Moldflow products you can set up the simulation to mimic your specific molding process . 
After the simulation is complete ,  you can quickly analyze the results and share the detailed discoveries with your team . 
Thanks to this in-depth simulation you will have the data to redesign your part quickly ,  improve part quality ,  and reduce visual defects and cycle time .

If ,  for a well-constrained model ,  your deformation values keep changing substantially  ( more than a few percent )  ,  review your model loads ,  constraints ,  contacts ,  and material stiffness .

Areas such as the edge at a sharp concave corner ,  shown in the following image ,  can cause stress singularities .  
If the maximum von Mises ,  principal stresses ,  or minimum safety factor continue to increase or change substantially ,  your model could have a stress singularity .  
For example ,  replace the sharp concave corner with a finite radius fillet as shown . 
Finite stress values using linear elasticity assumptions are not attainable at stress singularities .

As a result ,  the convergence plot points could represent different regions of your model ,  for example two different fillets with high stresses .  
If these points are not singular ,  such that finite stresses are attainable ,  you can isolate a region of interest to evaluate stress convergence .  
In addition ,  when maximum stresses exhibit large oscillations ,  the model could have competing stress concentration regions .  
If you cannot ignore localized high stress/singularity areas ,  as in the case of a  { 1 } sta_8 . htm { 2 } brittle material { 3 }  ,  you could introduce a modification to obtain converged stresses .

What is the expected material behavior?
If your model involves different ductile materials ,  the safety factor plot is more revealing as it already accounts for the yield strength of each material . 
Also ,  if the stress values seem correct but the displacements values appear unreasonable ,  double-check your material properties .  
As localized plastic strain in the region has a strengthening effect ,  you need not employ stress concentration factors .  
Ductile materials can show significant yielding ,  before failure ,  at true failure strains of 5% or larger . 
However ,  if yielding is widespread ,  for example through a cross-section ,  then you can expect failure . 
Show me the  { 1 } *1|*1 , 1 { 2 } von Mises Stress plot { 3 }  . 
Assuming that fatigue loading is NOT a concern ,  it is suggested that stress risers and stress singularities can cause localized yielding when subject to static loads .

However ,  as long as the parts remain bonded ,  you can obtain valid deformations and stresses since external loads and reaction forces are statically balanced .  
To illustrate ,  take the case of a box on rollers as shown .  
 { 1 } Note :  { 2 }  { 3 } For modal analysis ,  where no or only partial constraints are used ,  rigid body modes are calculated which have zero or near zero  ( numerical noise )  frequencies .  { 4 } 
The horizontal force ,  however ,  is not balanced and horizontal motion of the box occurs .  
There are some exceptions ,  for example when forces are balanced such that a valid ,  static solution for stresses is attainable .  
 { 1 } Note :  { 2 }  { 3 } The displacement field is not unique since they can be augmented by any combination of the three rigid body modes .  { 4 } 
Any unconstrained single body ,  or assembly with all its bodies bonded ,  has three translational and three rotational rigid body modes .  
The top and bottom faces have frictionless constraints ,  as indicated by the red arrows ,  which neutralize the net moment created by the force couple .  
Therefore ,  the total rigid body modes for an assembly could be far more than six .  { 1 } 
The inertial and reaction forces at joints serve to make your static stress analysis well-constrained at any given instant . 
 { 1 } Well-Constrained and Stable Conditions { 2 } 
While the box has three rigid body modes ,  the rollers balance the vertical force resulting in a valid stress field .  
For assembly motion ,  you can obtain loads from Dynamic Simulation .  
Otherwise ,  obtaining a valid static solution requires special care to ensure that forces are balanced in such a way that motion cannot occur in unconstrained directions . 
Therefore ,  you cannot obtain valid deformation and stress fields using static analysis .   { 1 } 
Equal and opposite forces are applied to each part ,  as indicated by the yellow load glyphs ,  and the parts are bonded at the red contact surface .  
Check the reaction forces at constrained boundaries ,  to ensure they reasonably balance the applied forces .  
Autodesk Inventor Stress Analysis assumes that the model is well-constrained ,  in the sense that no free fall or rigid body movements can occur .  
Changing the bonded contact type to separation or sliding ,  for example ,  unbalances the horizontal forces such that a valid static solution is not attainable .  
If reaction forces are unreasonable ,  check for unbalanced loads ,  missing contacts ,  incorrect contact type ,  or too coarse of a mesh in contact areas . 
Well-Constrained and Stable Conditions
 { 1 } Note :  { 2 }  { 3 } In assemblies ,  where many disconnected bodies or subassemblies are possible ,  each connected set of bodies could have six rigid body modes .  
These constraints only remove three rigid body modes ,  one translational and two rotational ,  while three other rigid body modes remain .  
Through combinations of various constraints and contact types  ( for assemblies )  ,  the six rigid body modes for each body can be eliminated .  
Consider the two-part assembly ,  as shown ,  in which the upper part is bonded to the lower part .

In the early stages of infrastructure project development ,  teams are typically working towards the creation of 30% plans . 
These plans can be used to confirm scope ,  budget ,  and schedule . 
How can teams more efficiently generate quality comments and a solid understanding of design intent?
The answer :  workflows that combine the power of Autodesk InfraWorks and AutoCAD Civil 3D . 
The preliminary design model elements can be brought into Civil 3D in order to create exhibits that are often required for 30% plan submittals , 
including approximate right-of-way plans ,  plan and profile sheets ,  and a first run of cross sections . 
In addition to the 2D plan documents ,  participants can explore the 3D model in InfraWorks
during preliminary design review meetings . 
Possible scope changes can be more easily evaluated and considered , 
since adjustments can be made to the model on the fly during the meeting . 
Once agreement has been reached ,  teams can continue refining the model with InfraWorks , 
and bring model components into Civil 3D when appropriate to begin more detailed design work .

Part modeling basics
No LT
If you create features using the symmetry option ,  the planes can be used to position the components in an assembly . 
For example ,  create the tangent work plane ,  and then start a 2D sketch on the work plane . 
In this example ,  the curved geometry is projected to the sketch plane as lines . 
The midpoint of the line is used to center the hole on the curved face . 
An offset work plane is created to set the distance ,  and an axis is created to specify the center . 
If you primarily import AutoCAD data for re-use ,  consider changing the  { 1 } Open { 2 }  default setting to  { 3 } Import { 4 }  in the Application Options . 
The import wizard lets you import all layers or only the layers you need – notice that you can set the background color and use view commands in this panel . 
Grounded Work Points let you specify the X ,  Y ,  Z location ,  rotation angle and are moveable . 
Click each plane to start a 2D sketch ,  and then create the required sketch shape . 
Notice that there are two solid bodies in the browser . 
These are just a few of the ways that work features can help you create your model . 
Notice that you can name the part files before you export . 
Create an assembly to position components ,  define movement ,  check for interference ,  and create a Bill of Materials
Right-click when you place a component to view the options .  
It is a good practice to ground at least one component so that it does not move . 
This provides an anchor for the other components . 
In this example ,  I am going to use the right-click context menu and select Place Grounded at Origin . 
This grounds the component and aligns the component coordinate system with the assembly coordinate system . 
When you place a component ,  you can use the context menu to orient about the X ,  Y ,  or Z before placing . 
If you have multiple view windows open ,  you can use Drag and drop from the browser of another file to add components . 
The option to rotate before placing is not available using this workflow .  
Use the Joint or Constrain command to position components and define motion . 
Joint explicitly defines the connection type ,  position ,  and motion .  
When you use the Joint command ,  be sure to select the object to be moved first and the stationary object second . 
The joint type is automatically determined by the geometry you select ,  but you can change the joint type before you accept .  
The { 1 }   { 2 } Constrain command offers a deep set of relationship tools ,  but does not contain explicit connection definitions .  
You can use both types together to obtain the required results such as this example using an axis to axis constraint to complete the mechanism . 
Use the Show Sick and Free Move commands to troubleshoot relationships . 
Both Joint and Constrain can describe a range of motion limits . 
This example uses joint limits to define the start and end position . 
Joint limits are accessed from the dialog box . 
There are two primary workflows used to describe the assembly design process :  top down and bottom up . 
In a top down workflow ,  the components are designed together such as this fan designed as a single multi-body part . 
Moving the end of part marker demonstrates the workflow used to create this part .  
When you finish a multi-body part ,  you can use Make Components to create an assembly file .  
This toy train is another example of a top down workflow . 
It uses a master 2D sketch and sketch blocks to define the size and layout information .  
You can incorporate mechanism movement in a 2D sketch to determine if components are sized and positioned correctly . 
Inventor 2014 users can take advantage of multiple enhancements that target large assembly performance . 
This is often used when the size and shape of a component is known . 
After you create the assembly ,  drive a joint or constraint to animate your design . 
For more information on placing and connecting components using joints and constraints ,  try the Assembly  { 1 } Place and connect parts { 2 }  Interactive Tutorial . 
To begin ,  a new method of opening very large assemblies called Express is introduced which accelerates the open time . 
If you are in Express mode ,  you can click Full mode at any time to enable all assembly commands . 
Let’s use the new Express workflow to take a look at the actual open time of this model with 3 , 864 occurrences . 
The normal open time for this model on my workstation with Inventor 2013 is approximately one minute ,  thirty seconds . 
The following real time video sequence shows opening the assembly in Express mode . 
As you will see ,  Express greatly accelerates the open time . 
Approximately 10 seconds later ,  you are ready to work!
Notice that you can use Representations in Express mode . 
In the first release of Express ,  you need to open a component in a separate window to perform an edit . 
Let’s activate a view rep that removes the cab and then use the measure command . 
In this example ,  I will open the tire and suppress the tire tread . 
Notice that the change is immediately visible when I return to the assembly . 
Let’s take a look behind the scenes at how Express mode works . 
If selected ,  assembly files saved in Inventor 2014 include additional information required for Express mode . 
New application options in the Assembly tab enable or disable saving the data required for Express mode in the assembly file . 
You can set a threshold to determine if the assembly opens in Full or Express mode . 
In this example ,  assemblies that contain 500 or more unique files open by default in Express mode . 
Notice a file open option is included if you want to bypass the threshold settings . 
In this example ,  the option is not available because the assembly has not been saved with the necessary Express mode information . 
Whether you use Express mode or Full mode ,  all large assemblies benefit from enhancements made to the Inventor graphics display . 
To demonstrate the change ,  I will open the model in 2013 . 
The fastest frame rate available in the options is 10 Hz . 
At 10 frames per second there is considerable drop off when you rotate ,  and there is no intelligence about what is displayed . 
The fastest possible frame rate in Inventor 2014 is 20 Hz ,  and the graphics are intelligent . 
New code draws large objects first ,  and the graphics card processing power is utilized . 
Drawings are another pain point when working with large assemblies . 
In previous releases of Inventor ,  a view always attempted to become precise . 
By specifying the new Raster option in the drawing dialog box you can control if precise view calculations are performed . 
By creating or converting views to raster ,  you can defer the cost of precise drawing view recompute when you edit a large model .  
A raster view displays in the browser with a diagonal red line through the view entry .  
New Layer Standards and Layer Key Styles have been provided that are based on the United States NCS 5 . 0 Standard .  
Please make sure to install AutoCAD first and then install AutoCAD Architecture or AutoCAD MEP . 
These begin the process of unifying Architecture and MEP Layer Standards ,  using “General” layers for annotation rather than the previous “Architecture” layers .  
The AutoCAD Architecture & AutoCAD MEP 2014 Object Enabler doesn't work on AutoCAD if AutoCAD is installed side by side after either of these vertical programs .  
The sync engine can only handle one operation at a time ,  so you need to wait for the sync operation to be completed before you move or copy another file to the Autodesk 360 folder . 
The previous forms ,  AIA Version 3 Layer Standard and AIA  ( 256 Color )  Layer Key Style ,  are still present in the new Layer Standard drawing .

Are all the modal frequencies outside the loading or operating/interfering frequencies?
This simulation application provides advanced dynamic response functionalities you can use for these types of analyses .  { 1 } 
If yes ,  then your design appears acceptable with respect to avoiding resonance .  
With the mode shapes as expected ,  let us assume that you have taken enough modes into account to capture the dynamic behavior of your model .  
Results Guide
If no ,  then  { 1 } mod_3 . htm { 2 } your design could require modification to avoid resonance { 3 }  . 
As a consequence ,  the simulation excludes post yielding ,  plastic deformation ,  hysteresis ,  and more . 
The isotropic assumption excludes the effects of orthotropic ,  anisotropic ,  or laminated material behavior while homogeneity relies on uniform material behavior throughout any part . 
Autodesk Simulation Mechanical/Multiphysics  ( Algor )  provides extensive capabilities for such simulations needs .  { 1 } 
 { 1 } Assumptions of Linear Static Analysis { 2 } 
Autodesk Inventor Stress Analysis assumes that the simulated materials and parts  ( single body )  behave in an elastic ,  linear ,  isotropic ,  and homogenous fashion . 
 { 1 } Note :  { 2 }  { 3 } Separation still assumes that each body is in the linear elastic zone ,  so both material and geometric linearities  ( small deformation )  are valid .  { 4 } 
 { 1 } Note :  { 2 }  { 3 } Depending on your model stiffness ,  certain external load increases could result in your model operating outside the material and geometric linear elasticity region .  
Assumptions of Linear Static Analysis
Staying in the elastic zone assumes that model materials fully recover to their preloaded state when loads are removed .  
The assumption also applies to geometric linearity ,  where the part stiffness remains constant during the loading to the exclusion of large deformations ,  large strains ,  and more . 
The only potentially nonlinear behavior accounted for is when contacts allow separation .  
For separation cases ,  the ratio of load versus deformation could change .  
In cases where your model operates outside of the linear region ,  consider further investigation using simulation resources that can account for nonlinear behavior .  
The linearity assumption applies to material linearity ,  where stress-strain ratios are constant during the loading .  
Make sure that these underlying assumptions are valid for your model behavior ,  since their violations could lead to irrelevant and/or incorrect design conclusions .  
Different physical contact areas at different load levels can change the equivalent stiffness of the full model .

SDE provides a command line to help set the value .  
Click on the Login button in the right panel and input the username/password for the SQL Server and click ‘Connect’ . 
If a user needs to fetch custom definitions from a previous Map release ,  CsUpdate . exe needs to be executed manually .  
Autodesk AutoCAD has added support for new Point Cloud file formats  ( file extension RCP and RCS for project and scan files respectively .  )  
Custom Coordinate Systems
  { 1 }  { 2 } 2 new geographic systems ,  22 projected systems ,  one new datum ,  2 new geodetic transformations and a new category were added to the coordinate system dictionaries . 
Close the ‘Connect to Data’ dialog . 
The work around is to reset the SDE MAXDISTINCT configuration setting to a larger value .  
For further details about this configuration setting ,  please refer to ArcSDE documentation . 
This command will then behave as if the Map is not geo-referenced .  
The point cloud image on the screen will be incorrect . 
SDE has a maximum distinct value configuration parameter with a default value of 512 .  
Use the following workaround when connecting to the SQL Server 2012 database : 
As a result ,  the geo-marker field in the main status bar will display “Unrecognized” instead of the coordinate system name . 
In this example { 1 }  ,  's' { 2 }  is the host name ,  ' { 3 } i { 4 } ' is the port number ,  'u' is an  { 5 } sde { 6 }  user name ,  'p' is the password ,  and 'v' is the setting change .  
After using these steps the publish operation should be successful . 
Right click on  { 1 } IndustryModel_x { 2 }  then click ‘Disconnect’
CSUpdate { 1 }  is typically installed in "c : \Program Files\Autodesk\Autodesk AutoCAD Map 3D 2014\csupdate . exe" . 
Open the ‘Connect to Data’ dialog and look for the  { 1 } IndusrtyModel_x { 2 }  connection under the ‘Add SQL Server Spatial Connection’ node . 
User definitions can be exchanged with another user by copying the entire file in the same location on another machine . 
Autodesk AutoCAD Map 3D doesn't support using these types of Point Cloud entities as a Display Manager element .  
User definitions are now separated from the installed coordinate system dictionaries and stored at :  c : \Users\XXXcurrentuserXXX\AppData\Local\Autodesk\User Geospatial Coordinate Systems .

When laying out a pressure network ,  it's common to have to go around adjacent utilities . 
For example ,  there is not enough clearance between this pressure network and this sewer network . 
Plan and profile views are helpful ,  but they can limit your view of the clearance . 
Sometimes it's easier to work in a model view because it's not restricted to just two planes . 
To provide more clearance around this sewer pipe ,  I'll shorten this pipe and continue the layout . 
I want to add a four-foot vertical rise ,  but the compass is currently displaying angles in the horizontal plane . 
So I'll press P to rotate the compass to a new plane , 
and then I'll continue laying out parts ,  entering dimension values as I go . 
To give yourself the flexibility to model in a greater number of planes , 
you can reduce the increment of the compass rotation . 
If I reduce the value from 45 to 15 degrees , 
the compass rotates in 15 degree increments . 
You can rotate the compass in the reverse direction by pressing Shift and then P . 
Once a pressure network has been laid out ,  there are a couple ways to relocate parts while maintaining their relationship to one another . 
First ,  you can slide a series of parts along a pipe . 
For example ,  I'll select a range of parts between this Tee .  .  . 
 .  .  . and the last pipe in the branch . 
Then I'll select one of the ports of the Tee to specify the slide direction . 
As I slide the parts ,  the lengths of the adjacent pipes are updated to accommodate the new location , 
but their location does not change . 
Next ,  you can move a series of parts to a new location . 
If I move the parts between these all elbows , 
the adjacent pipes are modified to maintain the connections . 
Moving parts could add deflection between connected parts , 
so you'll want to run a design check to check the angles of deflection . 
As necessary ,  you should insert different fittings
and clean up the pipe connections to accommodate the new angle between connected parts . 
The move and slide tools also work in plain view . 
In a case like this ,  where parts overlap each other ,  it's helpful to use the model view to select the parts .  .  . 
 .  .  . and the plain view to place the parts
The ability to use the same tools in multiple work planes gives you a great deal of flexibility when laying out and editing a pressure network . 
Autodesk InfraWorks enables you to quickly create visually accurate 3D conceptual models . 
You can export objects from a conceptual model to Autodesk AutoCAD Civil 3D for detailed design and analysis
and then bring them back into Autodesk InfraWorks . 
I'm going to use AutoCAD Civil 3D to create an access road to the south end of this conceptual development . 
To do this ,  I'll export a portion of the model to an IMX file . 
I need to export only the area where I'll design the road ,  so I'll define the area using a bounding box . 
I'll accept the coordinate system and the target file location , 
and export the data . 
I'll bring the data into an empty AutoCAD Civil 3D drawing using the Import IMX command . 
I don't need to set a coordinate system for the drawing ,  because it will be set automatically when the IMX file is imported . 
The IMX import process converts the Autodesk InfraWorks terrain surfaces ,  roads ,  and utilities
into TIN surfaces ,  centerline alignments ,  and pipe networks . 
I can use the imported objects as a reference to create a corridor model of the access road . 
Then I'll export the Civil 3D model to an IMX file . 
The IMX file is created in the same location as the drawing . 
Before I import the corridor into the original model ,  I'll create a new proposal . 
Now I'll use the data sources panel to load the IMX file . 
The pipes and structures were not changed ,  so I will not import them back into the model . 
I'll refresh the terrain model to display the corridor surface . 
And I'll configure the road for display as an Autodesk InfraWorks road . 
Now I can use Autodesk InfraWorks styles to visualize the new road . 
Autodesk InfraWorks and AutoCAD Civil 3D can be used together to iterate and visualize complex infrastructure designs .

Large ,  complex Revit models can easily exceed these limits at this time .  
The goal is that compared to manually created EAMs ,  there is a very significant saving in time without too much compromise capturing the main geometric characteristics of the building that influence energy use . 
Shade surfaces in particular have a limit of 1 , 024 surfaces ,  which can be easily exceeded when space leaks occur in the EAM creation .

If you have Autodesk Inventor 2013 installed on the same computer ,  it is essential that you install Update 1 for Inventor 2013 SP1 . 1 to correct issues with running Autodesk Inventor 2013 with  . NET 4 . 5 . 
Some objects in Factory files are invisible in Express mode . 
Windows 7 :  Windows Update is located in the Control Panel ,  which is accessible from the Start menu . 
Inventor uses TrueType and OpenType fonts .  
This tool recognizes and uninstalls the following components : 
While in-place editing a grounded subassembly ,  if you pause the cursor over any of its components ,  the cursor changes to indicate a grounded component ,  even if the component is not grounded within the subassembly . 
 { 1 } #_Autodesk_360 { 2 } Autodesk 360
2001 Plus – 2013
In assembly section view ,  if you orbit or pan the model ,  the performance is slower than Inventor 2013 . 
This Service is a part of Citrix EdgeSight and any need to run EdgeSight alongside Inventor 2014 requires contact with Citrix Support for potential workarounds . 
The Auto Recognize tool hangs on certain models that have complex geometry ,  or contain over 1000 faces . 
When switching between Express and Full modes ,  if you suppress and/or unsuppress a Joint relationship ,  its visibility status goes out of sync between the model browser and graphics window . 
Installing Inventor 2014 causes the Inventor 2013 Save & Send to Cloud feature to fail to create Autodesk 360 thumbnails and 3D views for the Saved & Sent assembly files . 
On Windows 8 operating system ,  the Application window intermittently goes black when you switch from Express Mode to Full Mode for large datasets . 
Sliding and cylindrical joints sometimes encounter an error when finding the limit condition for Dynamic Motion . 
Inventor 2014 contains VBA 7 which runs natively on 64-bit Windows ,  which eliminates the delay in previous versions of 64-bit Inventor to load and display the VBA development environment .  
Before you use the Close All command ,  please exit the Recognize Revit Feature environment . 
Express Mode is not available for Mold and Weldment assemblies ,  and the Load Express command is disabled for these assemblies . 
After the files are extracted ,  the Inventor installer wizard launches automatically .  
When working with assemblies with more than 25 , 000 components ,  we recommend using a 64-bit machine with 20 GB or more of physical RAM . 
For laptop computers with both an NVidia GeForce GPU and an Intel integrated GPU ,  change graphics from discrete GPU to Intel HD integrated graphics to ensure that Inventor 2014 works properly . 
 { 1 }  { 2 } Notes About Installation and Uninstallation
Before using Autodesk Multi-Sheet Plot  ( Start Menu -> Programs -> Autodesk -> Autodesk Inventor 2014 )  ,  verify that you have  { 1 } http : //usa . autodesk . com/design-review/download/?id=12423405&siteID=123112 { 2 } Autodesk Design Review { 3 }  installed on your machine . 
For machines with certain ATI/AMD graphics cards ,  to avoid issues in the graphics window ,  use the Performance or Compatibility graphics setting instead of the Quality setting . 
If you saved assembly datasets from Beta builds ,  please open and resave them in Full mode to update the graphics data in the  . iam files before you open them in Express mode . 
You cannot use Asset . Delete (  )  to delete a shared Appearance Asset . 
Autodesk Inventor 2014 installs  . NET 4 . 5 on Windows 7 operating systems .  
A point cloud does not display in the graphics window when the Compatibility graphics setting is used . 
If you require more detailed instructions ,  refer to the instructions provided with your delivered Autodesk Inventor 2014 media . 
A newly created empty Category in a shared Materials library is not visible to another user accessing the same library . 
If you invoke Print Preview for a drawing file while a part model is set to automatic Orbit in the background ,  an error dialog box appears . 
If a component is very small ,  its mass is considered as zero in this environment . 
If you create a subassembly in-place in an assembly ,  and then create a part in-place in that subassembly ,  when you open the subassembly in Express mode ,  the part is invisible . 
A crash sometimes occurs when you add a RSS feed within the InfoCenter Settings dialog ,  or a persistent recurrence of a No RSS Feed was found .  .  .  error dialog will be seen . 
Almost all existing macros run without any changes .  
You can delete a renamed Category containing appearances referenced by Material styles ,  which can lead to materials without appearances . 
You cannot use AssetCategory . Delete (  )  to delete an AssetCategory that contains a shared Appearance Asset . 
The few that require changes are the macros that directly call Windows API functions .  
 { 1 } #_Point_Cloud { 2 } Point Cloud
The suggested alternative to auto-run macros is to create an Inventor add-in . 
Express Mode workflows are disabled when ,  in the Applications Options dialog ,  Hardware tab ,  you sue the Compatibility graphics setting . 
In Express Mode ,  sketches and work geometry are visible only if they belong to the active top assembly ,  and are invisible if they belong to components . 
If you close and reopen a mold assembly model within the same Inventor session ,  you cannot perform a subsequent mold fill analysis on that model until you manually kill the persisting mitsi . exe process ,  or close and restart Inventor . 
To verify the installation was successful ,  start Inventor .  
When it is done ,  click Finish . 
If the Design Accelerator add-in is loaded ,  Inventor sometimes crashes when you place a Content Center component in an assembly in Express mode . 
On a 32-bit system ,  we recommend a minimum of 2 GB of RAM . 
Download the appropriate Inventor 2014 installation files to a temporary location on your computer hard drive or insert the supplied media into its appropriate drive . 
Additionally ,  check within the Windows Task Manager for an orphaned WSCommCntr4 . exe process and manually terminate it before running Inventor again . 
Section Views activated in Express Mode sometimes render incorrectly . 
On the iLogic tab ,  Manage panel ,  all commands for iLogic are disabled ,  but they are workable in the iLogic browser . 
When a component has a joint or constraint relationship with a work plane ,  performing a Free Move on that component sometimes results in visibility issues as the component passes behind the work plane in the graphics view . 
The new Self-Intersecting Sweep calculations are not used when the requested output of the Sweep operation is a surface .  
In Express mode ,  the Edit and Delete commands for iMates are available in some context menus ,  but are not officially supported . 
They can severely impact Inventor performance and pose a possible security risk .  
To avoid this issue ,  place Content Center components in Full mode ,  or unload the Design Accelerator add-in while you place Content Center components in Express mode . 
The presence of this folder prevents the above behavior .  
 { 1 } #Notes_About_Installation_and_Uninstallation_ { 2 } Notes About Installation and Uninstallation { 3 } 
When you enter the Recognize Revit Feature environment ,  Inventor sometimes hangs if the dataset contains over 4000 faces . 
Autodesk Inventor Content Center Libraries 2014  ( Desktop Content ) 
Express Mode does not support Realistic and Monochrome visual styles . 
After configuration ,  begin the installation .  
Macros run faster than before on 64-bit Inventor .  
Inventor 2014 removes support for VBA auto-run macros which are embedded in Inventor documents .  
You cannot use an empty row to split a drawing table . 
Autodesk has released Autodesk Inventor & Autodesk Inventor Professional 2014 .  
A crash occurs when you work on 32-bit operating system with point clouds .  
These VBA macros are named :  “AutoOpen” ,  “AutoNew” ,  “AutoSave” ,  “AutoClose” and “AutoEdit” .  
On Windows 8 operating system ,  the Application window temporarily goes black when some resource demanding operations are performed . 
In Express mode ,  the top assembly graphics does not update when you change the Level of Detail of its sub-assembly . 
At the c : \users\your_user_name\AppData\Roaming folder ,  navigate into the \Autodesk folder and manually create a \WebServices folder .  
This data includes Inventor disk and prerequisites disk requirements . 
You cannot pack the RCS point cloud files that reference the RCP point cloud files with the Pack & Go command . 
The following components were installed but are not recognized by the Uninstall Tool .  
Unigraphics V13 - NX 8 . 5
Then manually delete the shortcut that remains on the desktop .  
You cannot use AssetCategories . Add (  )  to add an AssetCategory that contains an Uncategorized Asset . 
Update the declaration of the Windows API function to be 64-bit compatible . 
Release Notes - Autodesk Inventor 2014 Read Me
Translation report does not display unit information when you import STEP ,  IGES ,  NX and SolidWorks files . 
Windows 8 :  Windows Update is located in the Control Panel ,  which is accessible on the desktop Charms Bar ,  Settings menu . 
A workaround is to first create a Solid Sweep ,  and then use Delete Face to remove the end faces to get the desired surface . 
We recommend 64-bit operating systems with a minimum of 4GB RAM . 
If you place custom Content Center parts in an assembly ,  sometimes the appearance of a part is lost . 
When you attach a point Cloud ,  Inventor hangs on certain hardware if the graphics driver is not updated to the latest version .

Building Energy Simulation Quick Start
Building Energy Simulation Detailed Workflow
When elements are selected ,  a contextual tab of tools displays on the ribbon and related options display on the Options Bar .  
You can create selection sets by picking an element at a time or by drawing a window to select the elements .  
What Understanding How to Select Elements is Important
When the Modify tool is active ,  click and drag the mouse to window select elements .  
Hold down the Ctrl key while selecting elements to add to the selection set ,  and host down the shift key while selecting to remove items from the selection set . 
This particular example uses the W-Wide Flange . rfa family ,  but all beams and braces  ( including those used in beam system pins ,  truss chords ,  and truss webs )  in the project should be upgraded . 
To perform  { 1 } Autodesk® 360 Energy Analysis { 2 }  on conceptual mass models ,  ensure that the Analyze and Massing & Site tabs are enabled .  
Detailed Building Elements for Energy Simulation
The building elements simulation option creates analytical geometry directly from your model and sends it to Autodesk Green Building Studio for evaluation .  
Once the analysis is complete ,  results can be viewed and compared . 
For in-depth analysis of a detailed model ,  you can perform whole building energy simulation analysis using detailed Revit models .  
Conceptual Masses for Energy Simulation
 { 1 } Autodesk® 360 Energy Analysis { 2 }  using conceptual masses provides early estimates for conceptual models before any detailed modeling occurs . 
Create a mass model ,  define analysis settings ,  and submit a conceptual mass simulation request to the Autodesk Green Building Studio web service .  
For detailed building models ,  ensure that the Analyze tab is enabled . 
 { 1 } Autodesk® 360 Energy Analysis { 2 } 
Perform Autodesk® 360 energy analysis for either detailed building element models or conceptual mass models . 
and detail view styles .  
These are the same settings that model documentation section views and model documentation detail views use . 
You can now control the appearance of section lines and detail views with section view styles { 1 }  { 2 } 
In addition to what I highlighted AutoCAD Mechanical inherits all the new features that AutoCAD 2014 brings .  
You can run through the AutoCAD New Features Video for a quick tour of the enhancements . 
Now if you press SHIFT G while dragging ,  the leader stretches instead of moving . 
We also enhanced the standard part library this release .  
The revisions for the Steel Shapes library for the Australian and New Zealand standards are as recent as 2010 .  
In previous versions of AutoCAD Mechanical ,  you could align balloons only in one direction . 
Roller Bearings are as recent as 2007 .  
You can now place balloons around the components you are ballooning .   
Previously ,  if you dragged the leader arrow of a symbol ,  the entire symbol would move .  
N { 1 } ow the same drafting standard settings control the appearance of both AutoCAD Mechanical entities as well as model documentation entities .   { 2 }

Before you install Autodesk Product Design Suite 2014 ,  please update your operating system .  
For Autodesk ReCap 2014 installations ,  we strongly recommend that you consume Service Pack 1 to address a known uninstall issue .

Autodesk  { 1 } Inventor { 2 }  2014 & Autodesk  { 3 } Inventor Professional { 4 }  2014
Due to interdependencies between multiple products and components ,  the Uninstall Tool is unable to list every item installed as part of a complete installation of the Product Design Suite 2014 .

All information provided is relevant to all three of the Product Design Suites 2014  ( Standard ,  Premium & Ultimate )  unless stated otherwise .  
If you need to uninstall all remaining components installed as part of the suite ,  access the Operating Systems uninstall capability on the Control Panel in Programs and Features and review the items listed based upon installation date . 
This Service Pack 1 has been released and is detected automatically by the installer if your system has an active internet connection .  
Now access the ADMS Console 2014 on your system and perform the desired migrations of custom content to the 2014 release .  
If you plan to install on a Windows 7 system that does not already have atleast  . NET 4 . 0 installed ,  then the manual installation of  . NET 4 . 5 prior to the installation of the Autodesk Product Design Suite 2014 ,  is recommended to avoid installation errors . 
If this occurs ,  you can access the 2014 uninstall Tool directly from c : \Program Files  ( x86 ) \Common Files\Autodesk Shared\Uninstall Tool\R1\UninstallTool . exe . 
This tool lists the majority of products and components installed by the Suite installer . 
Due to installation processing within the Product Design Suite 2014 installer ,  Raster Design 2014 is installed before AutoCAD Electrical 2014 making its functionality inaccessible from within that product .  
This Service Pack 1 has been released and will be detected automatically by the installer .

Start by uninstalling the Vault Server 2013 ,  leaving the existing 2013 libraries untouched .  
If you are installing Vault Server 2014 and wish to migrate your existing Vault Server 2013 installation and libraries ,  we recommend the following : 
 The Factory Design Utilities 2014 installed with the Suite are also compatible with point-products  ( Autodesk Inventor/Inventor Professional 2014 ,  AutoCAD Architecture/Mechanical 2014 and Navisworks Manage/Simulate 2014 )  that were installed prior to installing the Suite . 
You may need to install 2013 updates as a result of installing the Suite  ( and therefore upgrading to  . NET 4 . 5 )  . 
Follow the instructions to download and launch the Suite installer .  
Access the Autodesk Factory Design Suites 2014 installation files appropriate to your purchase type .

You can check in 3D Assembly files to Vault in Autodesk Inventor ;  then the linked 2D DWG file will be checked into Vault automatically . 
Alternatively ,  ReCap supports update notification capabilities to notify you of this Service Pack and automatically apply it .  
Annotation settings will only apply to subsequently created asset tags ;  previously created tags will not be affected . 
When opening the DWG that is generated by 'Sync AutoCAD' in AutoCAD Architecture ,  the units in AutoCAD Architecture may not be consistent with Inventor .  
Autodesk Inventor ,  Autodesk Inventor Professional ,  Autodesk AutoCAD ,  AutoCAD Mechanical ,  AutoCAD Architecture ,  Autodesk Vault Basic ,  Autodesk Vault Server ,  Autodesk Showcase ,  Autodesk 3ds Max Design ,  Autodesk Navisworks Manage ,  Autodesk Navisworks Simulate ,  Autodesk ReCap and Autodesk AutoCAD Raster Design are trademarks or registered trademarks of Autodesk ,  Inc .  in the United States and/or other countries . 
Select all entities you wish to uninstall and then click the Uninstall button .  
If you encounter unexpected status of Vault Check in and Check out ,  please close the document and reopen it .

Please do not republish an asset created in Factory Design Suite 2014 Beta with Annotations ,  or Inventor instability may be encountered . 
Autodesk  { 1 } AutoCAD Raster Design { 2 }  2014
Due to interdependencies between multiple products and components ,  the Uninstall Tool is unable to list every item installed as part of a complete installation of the Factory Design Suites 2014 .  
Another way is using Inventor's ‘Open DWG’ command to open the file and then close it .  
For all Autodesk ReCap 2014 installations ,  we  { 1 } strongly recommend { 2 }  that you consume Service Pack 1 to address a known Suite uninstall issue .  
Annotation with Japanese Fonts  ( 2-byte stroke fonts )  such as Extfont2 . shx ,  will not be displayed as is in AutoCAD Architecture or AutoCAD Mechanical . 
Removing passwords from the DWG file is a way to resolve it .  
 { 1 } http : //www . autodesk . com/raster-design-readme-2014-enu { 2 } http : //www . autodesk . com/raster-design-readme-2014-enu { 3 } 
If you are operating Sync AutoCAD or Sync Inventor with Vault located files ,  you may encounter an issue where the Check in button is greyed in AutoCAD Architecture or AutoCAD Mechanical .  
This will put the password into a session cache and then subsequent attempts to open it will work . 
Additionally ,  assets may also appear overlapped in the 3D layout .

You can find the following additional Mudbox resources online : 
Run the following commands to register Mudbox with the Autodesk licensing software ,  where  { 1 } <productKey1> { 2 }  and { 3 }  <productKey2> { 4 }  are your product keys ,  and  { 5 } <serialNum> { 6 }  is your serial number . 
If you're using a network license ,  you must also do the following : 
Create a file called mudbox . lic in the /var/flexlm directory with the following two lines : 
If you are installing Mudbox alone ,  enter the following : 
With the rpm command line utility ,  you can use either the -i flag or the -ivh flag to install the programs .  
To install the required software ,  enter either of the following commands ,  depending on whether you are installing Mudbox on a computer with Maya already installed : 
Install Mudbox on Linux using the rpm utility
SERVER  { 1 } < { 2 } licenseserver { 3 } > { 4 }  0
These commands return a Registration succeeded message ,  and you can now run Mudbox using your stand-alone or network license . 
The -ivh flag provides you with more information during the installation . 
Use the  { 1 } ls { 2 }  command to list the packages . 
 { 1 } MUDBOX_LICENSE_METHOD=network { 2 } 
To install Mudbox on Linux using the rpm utility
This step updates the product information  . pit file ,  which you can copy to other machines that have the same configuration if you are installing many instances of Mudbox . 
If you are installing Mudbox with Maya ,  enter the following : 
Look for a file named  { 1 } libGL . so { 2 }  in the  { 3 } /usr/lib/ { 4 }  or  { 5 } /usr/X11R6/lib { 6 }  directory to verify that OpenGL is installed . 
 { 1 } MUDBOX_LICENSE_METHOD=standalone { 2 } 
Locate and manually edit the License . env file to indicate which type of license you will use . 
where  { 1 } < { 2 } licenseserver { 3 } > { 4 }  is the host name or IP address of your license server . 
For example ,  you can run the following command in a BASH shell : 
Add  { 1 } /opt/Autodesk/Adlm/R7/lib64/ { 2 }  to  { 3 } LD_LIBRARY_PATH { 4 }  to set your shared libraries for this session . 
By default ,  the License . env file is located in the  { 1 } /usr/autodesk/mudbox2014/bin/ { 2 }  directory . 
If you purchased Mudbox as part of a suite ,  enter your Mudbox product key as  { 1 } productKey1 { 2 }  ,  and your suite product key as  { 3 } productKey2 { 4 }  . 
If you purchased Mudbox alone and received only one product key ,  you can enter the Mudbox product key for both  { 1 } < { 2 } productKey1 { 3 } > { 4 }  and  { 5 } < { 6 } productKey2 { 7 } > { 8 }  . 
Extract the Mudbox packages from the compressed file ,  then change to the directory where you extracted the Mudbox packages . 
The packages you see will be similar to the following ,  where # indicates the specific package numbers .

Opening a Drawing in AutoCAD 360
Host – specifies the WebDAV server address .  
The following example shows a sample XML that the WebDAV server returns containing all the information about the files and folders . 
Querying Files and Folders
Connecting to  { 1 }  { 2 } AutoCAD 360 { 3 }  { 4 }  Server
Using this sample code ,  you can : 
This sample code creates a new WebDAV client ,  connecting to the AutoCAD 360 server ,  with the username 'someuser' and password '123456' : 
Query file metadata . 
In these cases ,  there is no response to parse ,  but using the callback you will be notified when the operation is finished and whether it is was successful . 
Username – specifies your AutoCAD 360 account . 
For each file ,  the server states the creation date and its name . 
Perform various operations like copy ,  move ,  delete ,  and create folder . 
//subscribe to theDeleteComplete  ,  CopyComplete and MoveComplete events client . DeleteComplete -= new DeleteCompleteDel ( FSOpFinished )  ;  client . CopyComplete -= new CopyCompleteDel ( FSOpFinished )  ;  client . MoveComplete -= new MoveCompleteDel ( FSOpFinished )  ;  client . UploadComplete -= new UploadCompleteDel ( FSOpFinished )  ;  var overwrite = true ;  client . Copy ( "/Site/filea . dwg" ,  "/OtherSite/fileb . dwg" ,  overwrite )  ;  client . Move (  "/Site/filec . dwg" ,  "/OtherSite/filed . dwg'" overwrite )  ;  client . Delete ( "/Site/filee . dwg" )  ;  client . Upload ( "c : /fileg . dwg" ,  "Site/fileg . dwg" )  ; 
The C# Webdav client class relies on the standard WebDAV protocol to communicate with the AutoCAD 360 service . 
Use the PROPFIND method to copy ,  move ,  delete ,  and upload files . 
The following code demonstrates an implementation of the  { 1 } PropFindResponse { 2 }  function that prints the names of all items retrieved to the console . 
Copying ,  Moving ,  Deleting ,  and Uploading
Password – specifies your AutoCAD 360 account password . 
In this example ,  the server returns information about two files ,  'filea . dwg' and 'fileb . dwg' .  
Move  { 1 } /Site/filec . dwg { 2 }  to  { 3 } /OtherSite/filed . dwg
client . OpenDrawing ( "/Site/filea . dwg" )  ; 
WebDAVClient client = new WebdavClient ( "https : //dav . autocadws . com" ,  " { 1 }  { 2 }  { 3 } someuser { 4 }  { 5 }  { 6 } " ,  " { 7 }  { 8 }  { 9 } 123456 { 10 }  { 11 }  { 12 } " )  ; 
Working With C# WebDAV Client
Use this tutorial to perform various operations on files and folders in AutoCAD 360 using the C# client . 
PROPFIND / <handle>
Upload a local file from  { 1 } c : \fileg . dwg { 2 }  to  { 3 } /Site/fileg . dwg
In this example ,  the user will see these file names printed to the console : 
//subscribe to the PropfindComplete event client . PropfindComplete += new PropfindCompleteDel ( PropfindResponse )  ;  // request properties of all files/folders residing directly under the 'Site' folder .  
//responseStr is the full XML returned by the server .  //WebdavItemInfo holds partial information about each file/folder retrieved ,  such as its name ,  //relative path and whether it is a folder or a file .  
In this example ,  we subscribe the function PropfindResponse to the PropfindComplete event .  
The constructor of the Webdav client class expects three arguments : 
Use this sample code ,  which sends a request to the AutoCAD 360 server for retrieving information about all files and folders within the Site directory : 
After completing this tutorial ,  you would be able to : 
filea . dwg fileb . dwg
Query the file and folder directory for an account . 
In addition ,  remember to subscribe your callback function to the PropfindComplete event . 
public void FSOpFinished ( bool requestSuccessfull ,  int statusCode ,  String responseStr )   {  if ( requestSuccessfull )   {  Console . Out . WriteLine ( "success" )  ;   }  else  {  Console . Out . WriteLine ( "error :  " + statusCode )  ;   }   } 
Copy  { 1 } /Site/filea . dwg { 2 }  to  { 3 } /OtherSite/fileb . dwg
Connect to an AutoCAD 360 account . 
Use the  { 1 } OpenDrawing { 2 }  method of your WebDAV client by passing the path of the drawing for opening the drawing . 
remoteFilePath – specifies the relative path to the folder/file for which we wish to retrieve information . 
You should subscribe a callback function to the appropriate event  (  { 1 } DeleteComplete { 2 }  ,   { 3 } CopyComplete { 4 }  ,   { 5 } MoveComplete { 6 }  ,   { 7 } UploadComplete { 8 }  )  .  
Launch a drawing in the AutoCAD 360 editor . 
For example ,  if you want to connect to AutoCAD 360 server ,  use :  https : //dav . autocadws . com . 
depth – specifies whether the method is to be applied only to the resource  ( Depth = "0″ )  ,  to the resource and its internal members only  ( Depth = "1″ )  ,  or the resource and all its members  ( Depth = "infinity" )  . 
The following example shows the  { 1 } FSOpFinished { 2 }  function that prints to console the message 'success' in case the request ended successfully or the message 'error' with the status code in case of an error : 
The PROPFIND method receives two arguments : 
The files/folders are returned in d : response tag .  
Use the PROPFIND method to retrieve information about files and folders in AutoCAD 360 . 
client . Propfind ( '/ { 1 }  { 2 }  { 3 } Site { 4 }  { 5 }  { 6 } ' ,  1 )  ; 
public void PropfindResponse ( String folderHref ,  bool requestSuccessfull ,  int statusCode ,  String responseStr ,  List files )   {  XmlDocument xml = new XmlDocument (  )  ;  xml . LoadXml ( responseStr )  ;  XmlNamespaceManager xmlNsManager = new XmlNamespaceManager ( xml . NameTable )  ;  xmlNsManager . AddNamespace ( "d" ,  "DAV : " )  ;  xmlNsManager . AddNamespace ( "WSNS" ,  "WS" )  ;  //each child node is a 'd : response' node foreach  ( XmlNode node in xml . DocumentElement . ChildNodes )   {  XmlNode propStatNode = node . SelectSingleNode ( "d : propstat" ,  xmlNsManager )  ;  XmlNode propsNode = propStatNode . SelectSingleNode ( "d : prop" ,  xmlNsManager )  ;  XmlNode nameNode = propsNode . SelectSingleNode ( "d : displayname" ,  xmlNsManager )  ;  String name = HttpUtility . HtmlDecode ( nameNode . InnerXml )  ;  Console . Out . WriteLine ( name )  ; 
Delete  { 1 } /Site/filee . dwg
When Propfind is finished ,  Webdav client calls the PropfindResponse . 
/Site/filea . dwg HTTP/1 . 1 200 OK 2011-12-01T17 : 42 : 21-08 : 00 filea . dwg /Site/fileb . dwg HTTP/1 . 1 200 OK 2011-12-01T17 : 42 : 21-08 : 00 fileb . dwg
public void PropfindResponse ( String folderHref ,  bool requestSuccessfull ,  int statusCode ,  String responseStr ,  List files ) 
Same Origin Policy and Simple PHP Proxy
PROPFIND / <handle>
The PROPFIND method receives three arguments : 
You should subscribe a callback function to the appropriate event  (  { 1 } DeleteComplete { 2 }  ,   { 3 } CopyComplete { 4 }  ,   { 5 } MoveComplete { 6 }  ,   { 7 } UploadComplete { 8 }  )  .  
filea . dwg fileb . dwg
The constructor of the Webdav client class expects three arguments : 
Using this sample code ,  you can : 
The following example shows the  { 1 } FSHandler { 2 }  method that show a message box with the message 'success' in case the request ended successfully or the message 'error' with the status code in case of an error : 
Query file metadata . 
Ensure that your server is configured to run  . php files . 
Requests will be sent to the proxy ,  which in turn forwards the requests to the WebDAV server and returns the response to the client .  
SWFUpload is a JavaScript/Flash library ,  which gives you the option to add an Upload button to your HTML .  
Because of this issue ,  you cannot send WebDAV requests to a server that does not reside in the same domain as the  { 1 }  . js { 2 }  file . 
The files/folders are returned in d : response tag .  
/Site/filea . dwg HTTP/1 . 1 200 OK 2011-12-01T17 : 42 : 21-08 : 00 filea . dwg /Site/fileb . dwg HTTP/1 . 1 200 OK 2011-12-01T17 : 42 : 21-08 : 00 fileb . dwg
The Webdav client JavaScript class relies on the standard WebDAV protocol to communicate with AutoCAD 360 service . 
Connect to an AutoCAD 360 account . 
Delete  { 1 } /Site/filee . dwg
After completing this tutorial ,  you would be able to : 
The following code example shows a sample XML that the WebDAV server returns containing all the information about the files and folders . 
WebDAVClient client = new WebdavClient ( "https : //dav . autocadws . com" ,  "someuser" ,  "123456" )  ; 
Password – specifies your AutoCAD 360 account password . 
The proxy should reside in the same domain as the client .  
Username – specifies your AutoCAD 360 account . 
The same origin policy prevents document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from a different origin .  
As part of the basic security model of the Web ,  sites cannot usually make requests to pages on other domains .  
Query the file and folder directory for an account . 
Move  { 1 } /Site/filec . dwg { 2 }  to  { 3 } /OtherSite/filed . dwg
Querying Files and Folders
In these cases ,  there is no response to parse ,  but using the callback you will be notified when the operation is finished and whether it is was successful . 
Copy  { 1 } /Site/filea . dwg { 2 }  to  { 3 } /OtherSite/fileb . dwg
Launch a drawing in AutoCAD 360 editor . 
Use the PROPFIND method to copy ,  move ,  and delete files . 
In this example ,  the server returns information about two files ,  'filea . dwg' and 'fileb . dwg' .  
For example ,  if you want to connect to AutoCAD 360 server ,  use :  https : //dav . autocadws . com . 
The following line in the  { 1 }  . php { 2 }  file defines the real WebDAV server address : 
Perform various operations like copy ,  move ,  delete ,  and create folder . 
$real_destination_host = "https : //dav . autocadws . com" ; 
Connecting to AutoCAD 360 Web Server
This sample code creates a new WebDAV client ,  connecting to the AutoCAD 360server ,  with the username 'someuser' and password '>123456' . 
Use the PROPFIND method to retrieve information about files and folders in AutoCAD 360 account . 
The Flash code communicates with the  { 1 }  . js { 2 }  code using Flash's  { 3 } ExternalInterface { 4 }  class
//A handler the implements onSuccess and onError functions var handler = new PropfindHandler (  )  ;  // request properties of all files/folders residing directly under the 'Site' folder .  
depth – specifies whether the method is to be applied only to the resource  ( Depth = "0″ )  ,  to the resource and its internal members only  ( Depth = "1″ )  ,  or the resource and all its members  ( Depth = "infinity" )  . 
Use the OpenDrawing method of your WebDAV client by passing the path of the drawing for opening the drawing . 
handler – specifies an object that defines the callback functions  { 1 } onError { 2 }  and  { 3 } onSuccess { 4 }  ,  which are called when an error occurs during the request or when the request is successful . 
To workaround this issue ,  you can use a simple PHP Proxy .  
var handler = new FSHandler (  )  ;  var overwrite = true ;  client . COPY ( handler ,  '/Site/filea . dwg' ,  '/OtherSite/fileb . dwg' ,  overwrite )  ;  client . MOVE ( handler ,  '/Site/filec . dwg' ,  '/OtherSite/filed . dwg' ,  overwrite )  ;  client . DELETE ( handler ,  '/Site/filee . dwg' )  ; 
Copying ,  Moving ,  and Deleting Files
For each file ,  the server states the creation date and its name . 
Use this tutorial to perform various operations on files and folders in AutoCAD 360 using the JavaScript WebDAV client . 
URL – specifies the WebDAV server address .  
The following code demonstrates an implementation of the PropFindHandler ,  which shows an alert message box containing the status code in case of an error ,  or the names of the files/folders returned by the server in case of success : 
client . PROPFIND ( handler ,  '/Site' ,  1 )  ; 
path – specifies the relative path to the folder/file for which we wish to retrieve information . 
function PropfindHandler (  )   {   }  PropfindHandler . prototype . onSuccess = function ( result )   {  var names = '' ;  // each file/folder is defined within a 'response' tag var items = this . getElementByTagName ( result . content ,  'd' ,  'response' )  ;  for  ( i = 0 ;  i < items . length ;  i++ )   {  var props = this . getElementByTagName ( items[i] ,  'd' ,  'prop' ) [0] ;  var displayNameTag = this . getElementByTagName ( props ,  'd' ,  'displayname' ) [0] ;  var displayName = displayNameTag . childNodes[0] . nodeValue ;  names += displayName + '/n' ;   }  alert ( names )  ;   }  ;  PropfindHandler . prototype . onError = function ( result )   {  alert ( result . status )  ;   } 
Use this sample code ,  which sends a request to AutoCAD 360 web server for retrieving information about all files and folders within the Site directory : 
In this example ,  the user will see these file names printed to the console : 
Working With JavaScript WebDAV Client
function FSHandler (  )   {   }  FSHandler . prototype . onSuccess = function ( result )   {  alert ( 'success' )  ;   }  ;  FSHandler . prototype . onError = function ( result )   {  alert ( 'error :  ' + result . status )  ;   }

Press ESC or click any blank space in the drawing area
How does object selection work?
Select individual objects by clicking them . 
To Deselect All Objects
Press SHIFT and click object to either add them to ,  or remove them from ,  the selection set . 
It's an always-available ,  collaborative ,  solution for team members .  
As the owner of a drawing you can designate user type and permission settings when you choose to invite others to collaborate ,  review ,  or simply view your work .  
What is AutoCAD 360?
Whether you sit with your coworkers or across the country ,  you can all work on the same design at the same time .  
AutoCAD 360 is much more than cloud-based drawing and editing .  
By employing multiple separate layers for each user ,  you can be assured that what you've added to a design will not be modified ,  intentionally or accidentally ,  by someone else . 
For example ,  you can invite collaborators to work on the drawing with you and restrict their ability to invite others ,  or you can share the drawing with reviewers who can add markup ,  revision clouds ,  and notes ,  but cannot edit any drawing geometry . 
Use the Pan tool  { 1 }   ,  or the PAN command ,  to change the part of the drawing that is displayed in the drawing area . 
Click either the middle mouse button or the mouse wheel and drag to pan the view . 
Whats the difference between moving and panning?
Use the MOVE command to move selected geometry around within the drawing . 
Click and drag a selection to move it without typing the command .

Drawings are stored securely in the cloud using Autodesk 360 .  
What kinds of permissions can I control when sharing a drawing using AutoCAD 360?
Once I’ve granted access to someone to view a drawing ,  is it possible to revoke their access?
What’s the main benefit of this?
Can permissions be set on an individual basis when sharing a drawing with multiple people?
I understand AutoCAD 360 operates and stores my drawings in the cloud .  
For more information ,  visit  { 1 } http : //aws . amazon . com/security/ { 2 }  . 
Similarly ,  some email clients like Yahoo! 
Security FAQ
Later you can remove the share ,  and the drawing will no longer be accessible to them . 
AutoCAD 360 uses Amazon S3  ( Simple Storage Service )  ,  a leading service provider in data hosting and security . 
The most important benefit is having access to your drawings wherever you are on nearly any device  ( web browser ,  mobile devices ,  or desktop computer ) —all without the need install and maintain software on those devices .  
How secure is the data when I upload to AutoCAD 360?
Where does AutoCAD 360 store my data?
AutoCAD 360 offers the same level of security as email clients that do utilize the HTTPS security protocol  ( e . g .  Gmail ,  Microsoft Exchange ,  and Hotmail )  . 
Sharing with AutoCAD 360 is safer than FTP .  
also do not use the HTTPS security protocol ,  making AutoCAD 360 a more secure sharing option .  
Amazon Web Services offer the highest levels of security certification and accreditation ,  and operate in accordance with security best practices .  
AutoCAD 360 also allows you to store ,  view ,  and edit your files with other external storage solutions ,  including Dropbox ,  Box . com ,  Buzzsaw ,  or even your own hosted Sharepoint site or file server . 
Is sharing with AutoCAD 360 safer than this?
There are four possible combinations for permissions when sharing an AutoCAD 360 drawing : 
Is my data safe?
FTP does not use the modern ,  industry-standard security provisions of HTTPS used by AutoCAD 360 .  
Download Only { 1 }  :  User ( s )  cannot edit the original drawing ,  but can add to the drawing and mark it up  ( without changing any of the existing objects )  . 
Edit and Download { 1 }  :  User ( s )  can edit a drawing and download it for editing offline . 
Edit Only { 1 }  :  User ( s )  can edit the drawing ,  but cannot download it . 
All AutoCAD 360 drawings are fully encrypted using HTTPS with a 256-bit SSL certificate ,  the same industry-standard protocol used by international banks and Internet payment services for the transmission of sensitive business data . 
I typically share my designs using FTP or email .  
Will others have access to my drawings?
What if I don’t want to store my AutoCAD 360 designs on Amazon’s servers?
Cloud services also make it easier to collaborate and share your designs with others . 
For example ,  you can invite a client or group of colleagues to view and comment on your drawing .  
Only those who you’ve explicitly granted access to can view your drawings . 
No Edit and No Download { 1 }  :  User ( s )  can only add to the drawing and mark it up  ( without changing any of the existing objects )  ,  but will not be able to download the drawing . 
AutoCAD 360 is designed to be both highly secure and collaborative .

For detailed information on the mapping behavior of Revit dimensions when they are exported to AutoCAD dimensions ,  view the  { 1 } attached PDF { 2 }  . 
Behavior of Revit Dimensions when Exporting to AutoCAD
Import ,  Export ,  Layers
Underlined Dimension 
Angular Dimension
Filled Elevation/Heavy End 
If the dimension text in Revit has been moved ,  the dimension text location will change slightly in the exported DWG file  { 1 } when the dimension in the DWG file is regenerated .  { 2 } 
Revit exports the tick mark as a temporary graphic to preserve visual fidelity .  
The alternate units checkbox is unchecked
Alternate Units > Trailing
The alternate units checkbox is selected ;  The “After primary value” radio button is selected
Spot Elevation dimensions are exported as basic entities ,  such as lines ,  texts ,  etc . 
Revit always tries to map the Revit dimension parameters to the proper DWG Dimension styles properties .  
Alternate units of Angular
When “Text position” is set to “Next to Witness Line” and the Dimension Line Style is set to “Segment , ” the origin tick marks will be removed when the dimension in the DWG file is regenerated . 
Support Parallel to Dimension Line and Parallel to Witness Line
For Angular dimension :  if custom rounding is used ,  only the precision can be exported to the DWG file not the round off value . 
If the opening is dimensioned with a Spline leader in Revit ,  and then exported to DWG ,  the location of the dimension will change when the dimension is regenerated . 
The Opening Width is exported as dimension ,  but the Opening Height is exported as a dimension text override . 
The unit symbol is added as a dimension suffix on the primary dimension object
When you specify “Degree minutes seconds“ as units for angular dimensions ,  the unit will not display the same amount of rounding in the DWG file after the dimension in the DWG is regenerated . 
If you specify a number larger than 1 . 0e-8 for “Custom Rounding increment , ” the rounding increment will be treated as 0 rounding increment in the exported DWG file . 
Superscript in Revit will export as a dimension text override . 
Fixed length extension lines
The value for “Witness Line Length” is mapped to “Ext line fixed length” but the witness line length is calculated depending on the view scale .  
Dimension Spline Leader
The display of extension lines on an Angular Dimension is changed . 
Dot blank
Primary Units > Trailing
The display of dimension extension lines through the center will change . 
It will suppress the dimension/witness lines and set the arrow head style to “None , ” and export the text . 
Arrow Filled 20 Degree
Box Filled 3/32’’
Display in AutoCAD
Exported as a dimension text override 
Text view direction/Text inside align
Dot Filled 1/16’’
Alternate Units > Unit format
Text pos hor
Spot Slope dimensions are exported as basic entities ,  such as lines ,  texts ,  etc . 
Underlined Dimension is exported as a dimension text override . 
Arrow Filled 30 Degree
Dot Filled 1/8’’
Spaces display temporarily to preserve visual fidelity .  
Fixed length extension lines > Length
Case
Custom Rounding Increment 
The Associative property is set to ‘No’ in AutoCAD for dimensions exported from Revit . 
Dot small  
A closed filled arrow is assigned to the dimension style . 
The display of a dimension line extension is changed for a dimension that has the tick mark set to something besides “None” and “Diagonal . ”
Text specified for Above and Below is exported as a text override . 
The color set in the Dimension element’s type property will not be exported to DWG .  
Datum triangle filled
Closed filled
Applied as  Alternate dimension prefix
Primary Units > Round off
The parameter is not mapped
Offset from dim line
As a result ,  text location will change and may overlap other dimension values .  
Mapped to the DWG Dimension Style Property
Aligned Dimension
Alternate Units > Precision
At that point Revit will export the dimension to preserve its visual fidelity .  
Views on Sheet
The Annotative property is set to ‘No’ in AutoCAD for dimensions exported from Revit . 
If you override the project unit settings on a Revit dimension style ,  a new dimension style is created for the overridden dimension when it is exported to DWG . 
Dimension String Type - Baseline Dimension
The display of a dimension extension and a center mark is changed for radial dimension . 
Dot Open 1/16’’
Set on the Font Style
Triangle Filled 3/32’’
The display and the dimension of an arc length dimension will change . 
Lineweight
Primary Units > Scale Factor
There is no support for different arrow sizes for one dimension segment in DWG ;  therefore the size of the arrowheads may vary in some cases after the dimension in the DWG file is regenerated . 
Superscript
If you have any other tick marks specified other than “no arrow” or “oblique , ” the display for “Extended dimension line extensions” is changed . 
It will suppress the dimension/witness lines and set the arrow head style to “None , ” and it will not export text . 
Origin Visibility set to : 
Linear Dimension
Annotative
A unique text style is created . 
Spot Coordinate dimensions are exported as basic entities ,  such as lines ,  texts ,  etc . 
alternate Units > Round off
Radial Dimension
Heavy End 1/8’’
Box filled
But in some cases there may be parameters that cannot be mapped .  
Display in Revit
The spacing of the dimension text is different in a Revit file and in a DWG file .  
Bold/Italic 
Alternate Units > 0 feet
The value for “Line Weight” parameter is not mapped to the AutoCAD dimension style property for “Lineweight , ” instead it is set on the object itself . 
Dimension String Type - Ordinate Dimension
The color specified in the Layer table or in the Object Styles dialog is used . 
Radial Dimension Text
3-point Angular Dimension
When the Dimension Line Style is set to “Segment” in Revit ,  the display of the dimension will change . 
Applied as a Primary dimension prefix
Regular
The settings for Bold/Italic on the dimension text in Revit are not mapped to Bold/Italic on the DWG dimension style ,  if the font style does not support Bold and/or Italic .  
Center Mark Size and Radius Prefix
The settings for Center Mark Size and Radius Prefix will not persist when the dimension in the DWG file is regenerated .  
Unit symbol
Arrow Filled 15 Degree
They will be removed when the dimension is regenerated . 
Diagonal 3/64’’
Center Symbol ,  Pattern and Tick Mark
Below are known cases when that can occur : 
Primary Units > Precision
Dot filled dimension tick marks have varied sizes in the DWG file . 
Diagonal 1/8’’
It will not export the dimension .  
Fill Color 
Arrowheads > Second
Text style
Rotated views placed on sheets may get the read convention incorrect in the exported DWG file  { 1 } when the dimension in the DWG file is regenerated .  { 2 } 
However ,  since the text is exported as an override ,  the dimension value will not be converted to the unit that you specify during DWG Export .  
Set on the Text Style
Dimensions in Revit can use or override the project unit settings .  
If the checkbox in Revit is greyed out ,  the checkbox is also greyed out in the DWG file but it is selected . 
The dimension tick marks “Filled Elevation” and “Heavy End” will display as a “Closed Fill” arrow after the dimension in the DWG file is regenerated . 
The display of extension lines on an Arc Length Dimension is changed . 
Dimension Extension/Center mark
Rotated Dimension
However ,  the text that is exported will still display as Bold/Italic in AutoCAD . 
When the tick marks ,  extension lines and dimension pen widths are different on the dimension segments ,  a new dimension style will be created in the exported DWG file . 
Extend beyond dim lines
The unit symbol is added as a dimension suffix on the Alternate dimension
Extension Lines 
Exported as a dimension text override
Dimension String Type - Continuous
Alternate Units > Multiplier for alt units
The alternate units checkbox is selected ;  The “Below primary value” radio button is selected
Unit Symbol
Extend beyond ticks
The visual fidelity will only be a temporary display ,  as soon as the dimension is regenerated it will read its properties from the dimension style and the display may change .  
It will always read 10 . 00 { 1 } 5 { 2 }  .  
Known Behavior when a Revit Dimension is exported to DWG format
The display of a dimension extension is changed for a radial and an arc length dimension . 
Mapping Behavior when Revit Dimensions are E { 1 }  { 2 } xported to AutoCAD Dimensions
Spline dimension leaders will change to straight leader lines when the dimension is regenerated in the DWG file .  
Offset from origin
To keep data fidelity ,  the Scale Factor is used to simulate the dimension unit in the exported DWG file [ { 1 } Dimension Unit = Drawing Unit / Scale Factor { 2 } ] . 
Arrow 30 Degree
Arrowheads First and Second
Extension lines > Linetype
In Revit ,  the dimension value includes whitespace ,  but in AutoCAD the whitespace is removed .  
Revit Dimension Parameter
Arc Length Dimension 
Revit exports the center line symbol as a separate block { 1 }  to preserve visual fidelity .  { 2 } 
Dimension lines > Suppress
Arrowheads > First and Arrow Size
If the dimension text on a radial dimension has been moved in Revit ,  the location of the dimension text will move in the DWG file when the dimension is regenerated . 
Text specified for Prefix and Suffix map to Dim Prefix and Dim Suffix fields in the Properties dialog in AutoCAD . 
Associative
If you set the Alternate Units location = Below and the Read Convention = Horizontal ,  the location of the Alternate units will be changed when the dimension is regenerated .  
Dimension Extension 
Arc Length Dimension
This may cause unexpected results on export ,  for example ,  a dimension with the Text Width factor is changed .  
Primary Units > Unit format
Primary Units > 0 feet
Alternate units of Angular dimensions will export to AutoCAD to keep visual fidelity ,  but after the dimension is regenerated the alternate units will disappear .

AutoCAD 360 operates as AutoCAD does ,  incorporating the external files to present a drawing properly . 
To the right side of the window ,  a status will indicate whether files are 'updated' or missing . 
If you open a drawing that has a missing Xref file ,  AutoCAD 360 will notify you so that you can import the missing file to display the drawing .  
Use 'import' and 'update Xref's' to upload or update drawing Xref's .  { 1 }  AutoCAD 360 supports the use of a vast variety of external files ;  References files such as * . DWG ,  * . JPG ,  * . TIF or any other raster image ;  Plot style files  ( or style sheets )  such as * . ctb ,  * . stb ;  And fonts files such as * . ttf ,  * . shx .

Deleting a post is possible with iOS and in the web version of AutoCAD 360 .  
Be advised that only the originator of a post may delete it .  
Currently there is no delete function in Android .  
It lets you view previous versions and track all changes made by you and others to a drawing . 
The Version History is a visual representation of the history of your drawing in AutoCAD 360 .  
Because AutoCAD 360 is a web application ,  all the different versions are automatically saved on the AutoCAD 360 server ,  so there is no need to waste time by manually creating backups and copies . 
Access the file's Version History to locate your offline versions . 
Quick Tip :  { 1 }   { 2 }  { 3 } Your work isn't lost . 
All the work I did offline disappeared when I synced online ,  what do I do?
 { 1 }  { 2 }  Offline colliding versions are saved as earlier editions of files .  
To continue working with the changes you made offline ,  simply save the file under a new name . 
Offline changes will be archived as an earlier version on the file’s Version History  ( on the web app only )  . 
In the instance where there is a conflict between versions — e . g .  ,  changes that were made to the online version of the drawing ,  while other changes were made to the drawing offline — the changes that were made offline are uploaded to the Version History as an earlier version of the drawing .  
When this happens the user will receive a notification message in the mobile app ,  indicating that there is a more recent version of the drawing available for download .  
If you cannot seem to find the reset password email ,  check your spam folder .

How do I resolve a post in the Design Feed?
From that moment ,  that person will no longer be able to access your drawing ,  and the drawing will not appear in their AutoCAD 360 Drawings folder .  
You can remove all shares at once .  
In order to revoke a collaborator's access to your drawings ,  on the web app ,   go to the Share tab in the ribbon when in the Editor .  
Click on the collaborator's name from the drop-down list of options ,  and select “Remove Share” . 
How do I stop sharing a file?
Quick Tip :  { 1 }   { 2 }  { 3 } On the web app ,  go to the share tab and choose a collaborator to stop sharing your file with .  { 4 } 
Stop sharing is possible  { 1 }  { 2 } only from the web app . 
You do not need to save the drawing ;  the new permission controls are effective immediately . 
Right-click the drawing and select “Remove shares” . 
To make your drawing completely private ,  go to the Drawings section in AutoCAD 360 and find the drawing you’re looking for .  
A real-time collaboration session initiates when two or more users view a shared drawing simultaneously from respective web browsers or mobile devices . 
The same is true for zoom ,  layers ,  layouts ,  plot styles ,  and more .  
 A real-time collaboration session can include two or more users ,  sharing the exact same view .  
This means that when one user pans the view to the left ,  the other participants will see that pan .  
 { 1 } With the AutoCAD 360 share feature ,  you can also invite designing team members to meet online to review and edit drawings in a real-time collaboration session ,  simply by viewing a shared drawing simultaneously from respective web browsers or mobile devices . 
How does collaboration contribute to my workflow?
To start real-time collaboration ,  simply have your collaborators who share the drawing enter the drawing while you are in it too . 
You can also use the Chat feature to communicate with participants as you collaborate online .  
During the session you can even see the other participants’ mouse pointers ,  and every modification made to the drawing is visible in real time for the other participants . 
When you open a drawing ,  it will begin downloading while taking priority over the download that was in progress . 
Once it has completely downloaded it will indicate that the file is "Available Offline" { 1 }  { 2 }  with a date and time stamp . 
By default ,  AutoCAD 360 will begin downloading all the files you have in your online account to make them available offline .  
Even if there have been no changes to an online file since the last sync ,  it will be given a new time stamp to indicate that it is up to date .  
Quick Tip :  { 1 }   { 2 }  { 3 } The Sync button allows you to manually start to sync all your files .  { 4 } 
This will stop the download that was in progress and prevent further automatic downloads from continuing . 
The files will be downloaded to your device in the order they appear in the File Manager . 
You can stop the Sync process at any time by tapping the Stop Sync button .  
This will ensure that you always have the latest version of the files saved locally on your mobile device .  
Each file will display its progress as a percentage while it downloads .  
You can manually start a full sync of your online files at any time by tapping the Sync button .  
What is the sync button? 
The app will use the device’s GPS to determine the precise longitude ,  latitude and altitude coordinates of that point and will set that data to the drawing .  
The AutoCAD 360 GPS feature allows you to position yourself within your design and to use the built-in GPS functionality of your Smartphone or tablet to track your location on the design .  
After using the “My Location” feature ,  you can move around and notice that the location marker is tracking your movement within the drawing .  
As you move around ,  you can add comments to the design regarding precise geographic locations . 
Some drawings may already contain geographic location data  ( using the Geo Marker object )  and will not require you to set the location first .  
You can manually set your actual location on the design by tapping the “Set Location” button and choosing the point on the drawing that you are currently standing on .  
What is the GPS feature?
To achieve maximum precision on some devices ,  it is recommended to turn on the device’s GPS for a minute or two and let it calibrate before using it . 
Note that the accuracy of the AutoCAD 360 GPS function is dependent on the accuracy of your device . 
The AutoCAD 360 GPS functionality is dependent on your mobile device and its GPS coordinates .

Quick Tip :  { 1 }   { 2 }  { 3 } Each file will display its progress as a percentage while it downloads .   { 4 } 
If you have other file types in your online account ,  they will not be saved locally . 
How do I know if my file is saved locally or not?
Once a file has been saved locally it will be marked as “Available Offline { 1 }  { 2 } ” with a date and time stamp indicating the exact moment it was synced .  
Publishing a drawing generates a unique link to it that can be opened by anyone .  
The link can the be distributed via e-mail ,  IM ,  blogs ,  social networks and more . 
A published drawing is a drawing that the owner has made available to the public .  
A shared drawing is accessible to a group of people ,  based on personal invitations sent to them by the drawing owner .  
 { 1 } What’s the difference between a shared drawing and a published link { 2 } ?
 { 1 } On the web app ,  go to the 'View' tab in the ribbon and click on “Plot Styles” to { 2 }  import style { 3 }   { 4 } sheet from your computer .  
How to import plot styles  ( stylesheets ) ?
The plot style will then be imported to AutoCAD 360 and the after the drawing regenerate you can choose your custom plot style { 1 }  .  { 2 } 
When you open a drawing with a missing plot style ,  it will default to one of the preloaded plot styles .  
You cannot define and add a new plot style to a drawing with AutoCAD 360 . 
If you change the view in your drawing to a plot style without first importing the plot style ,  AutoCAD 360 will notify you that it’s missing ,  and will change the plot style to default Grayscale .  
Note that AutoCAD 360 will only recognize style { 1 }   { 2 } sheets that you defined in AutoCAD .  
How to use Trim\Extend?

Disabling the  { 1 } 'Edit' { 2 }  permission will allow your collaborator only to view the drawing and draw basic markups .  
When you share a drawing in AutoCAD 360 ,  you grant permission to a colleague or a client to view ,  edit or download a drawing .  
How do I define sharing permissions?
The default permissions allow your collaborators to edit and download your drawing : 
You can change the permissions at any time from within the Share tab in the ribbon ;  your new permissions will be in effect immediately . 
The collaborator will not be able to edit any of the objects . 
Quick Tip :  { 1 }   { 2 }  { 3 } Use the permissions control to specify whether your collaborators are allowed to edit the drawing online and/or to download a local copy of the drawing .  { 4 } 
The permissions dialog allows you to enable or disable these functions .  
Disabling the  { 1 } 'Download' { 2 }  permission will block your collaborator’s ability to create a copy of your drawing in their account or to download the DWG file to their computer . 
To change the permissions ,  toggle each permission's button  { 1 }  { 2 } On or Off . 
Autodesk 360 and AutoCAD  { 1 } 360 { 2 }   { 3 }   { 4 } are both cloud apps and as such they require you to upload the files to the cloud in order to render them and work on them { 5 }  . 
You should be able to use the same credentials to log in to both apps and once you do ,  all files will be synced between the accounts as well .  
Can I see my Autodesk 360 files in AutoCAD 360?

Remember ,  the temporary dimensions are to the nearest element ,  so the dimensions you see may be different from the original temporary dimensions .  
You can modify temporary dimensions to reference desired elements by moving the witness lines .  
You can also specify the display and placement of temporary dimensions . 
Temporary dimensions
For example ,  if you define the snap increment to 6 cm ,  the dimension increases or decreases in values of 6 cm as you move the element to place it . 
When you place another element ,  the temporary dimensions for the previous element no longer display .  
To view the temporary dimensions of an element ,  click Modify and select the element .  
After you place the element ,   { 1 } ProdName { 2 }  displays the temporary dimensions .

Partitioning a project for reinforcement serves a number of organizational purposes depending on how a building is designed or how it will be constructed . 
About Rebar Partitioning
If required ,  adjust number sequencing the Reinforcement Numbering dialog .  
Select one or more rebar elements to be associated with a partition . 
In the Properties palette ,  under Identity Data ,  enter a partition name or select a previously defined name from the Partition drop-down .  
Please note that the field will be empty if partitions have not yet been created for the project . 
<IMAGE PLACEHOLDER>
See  { 1 } Adjusting Rebar Numbering Sequences { 2 }  . 
The rebar is assigned to the partition . 
Click Modify | Piping Systems tab { 1 } Convert To panel { 2 }  ( add icon )  Placeholder or  ( add icon )  Design or  ( add icon )  Fabrication . 
To convert to fabrication parts ,  you must  { 1 } Select a Fabrication Service { 2 }  . 
You can convert selected elements or an entire piping system between design intent parts ,  placeholder parts ,  and fabrication parts . 
You can specify the function ,  material ,  and thickness of the layers you insert . 
If the Filter partitions field is empty ,  all partitions in the project will display in the list . 
 { 1 }  Minimum number of digits for reinforcement numbers  ( 10 maximum )  . 
Adjusting Rebar Numbering Sequences
 { 1 }  Specifies the first fabric sheet number in the sequence of the partition . 
Likewise ,  enter "level" will return "level_1 , " level_2 , " and so on . 
 { 1 }  Lists the names of partitions specified by the Filter partitions field .  
This is particularly useful in projects with a large number of unique partitions .  
The range highlights with an asterisk to indicate when one or more gaps exist in the sequence . 
Use the Rebar Numbering dialog to make adjustments to rebar numbering sequences and their appearance . 
For example ,  rebar number 3 at 5 digits displays as 00003 . 
 { 1 }  Specifies the digits displayed for a sequence .  
 { 1 }  Specifies the first rebar number in the sequence of the partition . 
 { 1 }  Select this tool to remove gaps in the sequence of the partition . 
 { 1 }  Displays the current numerical range in the sequence .  
 { 1 }  Specifies the partitions that are visible in the Rebar Numbering dialog .  
The sample family also illustrates the syntax for commonly-used formula types .  
You can convert selected elements or an entire piping system between design intent parts ,  placeholder parts ,  and fabrication parts . 
Turn off surface patterns for the affected elements :  right-click an element and click Override Graphics in View { 1 } by Element or by Category . 
You can flip the wall orientation while drawing the wall or after it is placed . 
You can remove rebar from a project and rebar numbers will persist unless specifically changed by using the Remove Gap tool in the Rebar Numbering dialog . 
<IMAGE PLACEHOLDER>
The rebar and fabric sheet numbers match those of the same type ,  size ,  material ,  and shape .  
Rebar Numbering
Rebar numbering and sequencing modifications are available for specific presentation and documentation needs .  
You can now assign partitions to rebar ,  rebar sets ,  and fabric sheets to better facilitate logical design ,  fabrication ,  delivery ,  and placement at a site .  
Rebar and fabric reinforcement now have a numbering sequence that match like types ,  size ,  and shapes .  
This numbering can be scheduled and applied to tags in documentation .  
The following parameters can now be included in a wall schedule or material takeoff  ( see  { 1 }  )  : 
Family Parameter order adjustment : 
You can now use a selection box to select multiple elements to trim or extend to a boundary defined by another element .  
Use the new Family Browser to explore families loaded in the current project .  
Add link from Manage Links dialog : 
Sketchy Lines :  Use the new Sketchy Lines feature to apply a hand-sketched graphic style to the current view ,  or define the settings in a view template to apply the style to multiple views .  
In the family editor ,  open a family ,  and open the Family Types dialog .  
View References :  You can now change the referenced view after a view reference has been created .  
Keynoting Settings  ( see  { 1 }  )  : 
When you duplicate a view ,  the default name for the copy is <view name> Copy 1 .  
Tag leader elbow behavior : 
Using the Add button on the Manage Links dialog ,  you can now link  { 1 } Revit { 2 }  models and CAD files to the project without having to exit the dialog and select another tool .  
Spacebar flips the arc direction in the cloud shape .  
Duplicate View default name enhancement : 
The keynote file can be located on a local or remote server . 
When you move a tagged element ,  or drag the tag head ,  the tag leader and elbow adjustment behavior is now consistent with that of text leaders .  
Family Browser :  The Families node of the Project Browser has been moved to its own dockable window .  
If more than 250 pins would be visible ,  then no pins display for that view .  
Even when the pins do not display ,  the commands related to pinning still function as expected . 
To support a simplified view ,  Revit will display only up to 250 pins in a view .  
Instead of permitting the deletion and providing a warning ,   { 1 } Revit { 2 }  will now warn you that the element is pinned and instruct you to unpin the element before using Delete .  
Pinned element behavior : 
Temporary View Properties :  In temporary view mode  ( a temporary view template is applied )  ,  you can now modify any instance property for the view ,  not only the properties included in templates and visibility/graphics overrides .  
 { 1 } Faster selection graphics { 2 }   :  When you select a large number of elements in the model ,   { 3 } Revit { 4 }  uses a new process for displaying the selected elements ,  so that software performance is improved .

 ( This chart is currently in beta )  . 
More efficient lights are the next biggest area for improvement over the baseline ,  and can improve energy performance by about 8% . 
 { 1 } 2 :  Run Status { 2 }  .  
For design teams working to reduce a building's energy use ,  the  { 1 } Potential Energy Savings { 2 }  chart is a tool to focus their limited time on only the features of a building's design ,  construction ,  and systems that can save the most energy .  
Follow instructions for submitting runs here : 
The chart is designed to enable these easy takeaways : 
Accessing the Potential Energy Savings Chart in Revit ,  Vasari ,  and GBS
When the alternate runs are complete ,  the Potential Energy Savings icon will appear in the far right column of the table within GBS . 
Currently ,  the Potential Energy Savings chart is only available through the Green Building Studio web interface . 
If there are multiple baseline simulations within a project ,  they and their alternative runs will likely be displayed on different pages by default .  
Click the "-" next to the Alternate Runs label to collapse the list . 
 { 1 } Sending Your Model to Green Building Studio Outside of Revit { 2 }  . 
The Potential Energy Savings chart is created automatically whenever you initiate an analysis run in Autodesk Revit ,  Vasari or Green Building Studio .  
To see the other run sets ,  choose to show more runs per page .  
 { 1 } Energy Analysis for Vasari { 2 } 
Each time a model is sent to Green Building Studio ,  the 37 additional alternative runs are created and nested under that base run . 
 { 1 } 3 :  Potential Energy Savings Chart Icon { 2 }  .  
 { 1 }  1 :  Alternative Runs for Each Model Submitted { 2 }  .  
If you navigate away from the page and return ,  or access this page after a Revit-initiated run has finished ,  these status bars will be replaced by the EUI and energy cost data for each run . 
Take care to avoid reducing energy performance by making sure you don't backslide on building features that have large bars on the left of the vertical line . 
You can either resumbit the base run or remove all the runs of the same parameter of the failed run to view the PES with the successful parameters . 
If any runs fail ,  the Potential Energy Savings chart will not generate .

Can I open  { 1 } Vasari { 2 }  Beta 3 files in Revit 2014?
 { 1 } Vasari { 2 }  Beta 3 is based on the Revit 2014 code base ,  but highlights the Conceptual Design environment and various other features .  
But really ,  anyone interested in 3D parametric modeling and looking for ways to understand 'performance-based design' is welcome to download and try it out . 
We think  { 1 } Vasari { 2 }  is a great tool for use in the early design stages of architectural design projects .  
2D analysis results are almost immediate .  
Detailed BIM modeling tools have been removed . 
Can I get accurate wind tunnel analysis results by using 2D alone?
Therefore ,  2D analysis should only be used as a first step in your analysis . 
So far ,  architectural designers and architectural students have been using early versions .  
We definitely want to hear from you! 
Inputs or outputs cannot be saved through the wind tunnel application at this time .  
We definitely want to see what you are designing! 
Tools available in  { 1 } Vasari { 2 }  are available in the  { 3 } Vasari { 4 }  API
What does "Vasari" mean?
Conceptual models created in any version of  { 1 } Vasari { 2 }  can be opened in Revit 2014 and used to make more detailed models . 
How do I know when a wind tunnel analysis is done?
In the wind tunnel tool ,  can I measure how much flow moves through an opening?
How can I share models and images with others?
Where can I find more details about the assumptions used to simulate energy performance?
 { 1 } Vasari { 2 }  Beta 3 will be available to use until May 31 ,  2014 . 
Disable completely removes workset designations . 
 { 1 } Vasari { 2 }  is a beta version .

What is the difference between detaching and disabling worksets?
 { 1 } Vasari { 2 }  is intended as an "on ramp" for Revit .  
Is there an API available for  { 1 } Vasari { 2 } ?
During a 3D analysis ,  a progress bar indicates when the 3D voxels have been initialized .  
Giorgio Vasari  ( 1511 - 1574 )  was an Italian painter ,  writer ,  historian ,  and architect . 
Who is  { 1 } Vasari { 2 }  intended to be used by?
Can I open Revit 2014 files in  { 1 } Vasari { 2 }  Beta 3?
Detach creates an independent file and prohibits saving changes back to the original central file while workset designations are preserved .  
Yes ,  but some features  ( detailed model elements such as walls ,  windows ,  doors ,  etc .  )

To convert elements in a design-intent layout to fabrication parts ,  you must first specify a fabrication configuration for the project .  
The default fabrication configurations contain content sourced from Autodesk Revit Fabrication  ( MAP )  databases . 
With a project open ,  you can reload a fabrication configuration to obtain the latest fabrication content . 
In order to specify a fabrication configuration for the current project ,  the configuration must reside locally on your network or local drive . 
If you open a project and changes have been made to the fabrication configuration ,  you'll need to specify whether  { 1 } R_MEPProdName { 2 }  should use the current configuration or the updated configuration .  
Unlinked configurations show as Disconnected in the Fabrication Settings dialog .  
When you specify a fabrication configuration ,  it becomes linked or connected to the project .  
If you choose to use the current configuration ,  the link to the updated configuration is removed and the configuration is disconnected from the project .  
To manage fabrication configurations with Autodesk 360 ,  click Access to Online Fabrication Database .  
Click and drag beam ends to adjust their end extensions or cutback in Medium and Fine Detail Levels . 
End extensions extend beyond the location line and end handles  ( blue circles )  of the framing element .

As a result ,  the interactions in this app can also differ .  
The Project Data option is only available if you use Fusion 360 or Sim 360 . 
Fusion 360 handles data differently than Autodesk 360 .  
Currently ,  this app lets you connect only with Autodesk 360 and Fusion 360 storage . 
On the Navigation panel ,  what's the difference between My Data and Project Data?
If you use Fusion 360 or Sim 360 ,  you can also use those services to upload documents . 
Uploading a new version of the document removes all views stored in the cloud . 
Whereas documents stored on Autodesk 360 support different markup types and up to three image attachments per markup .  
For example ,  documents stored on Fusion 360 only support Comment markups and just one image attachment per markup .  
Why do some documents stored on Fusion 360 behave differently in this app than those documents stored on Autodesk 360?
The My Data option provides access to documents stored on Autodesk 360 .  
Tip :  You can also double tap with two fingers to switch between the home view and the current view . 
The document file type and and its storage location can determine the available comment types .  
However ,  when those same file types are stored on Autodesk 360 ,  this app does enable you to view them . 
Tap Post . 
What file types are viewable in this app?
Additionally ,  some file types ,  such as NWD ,  RCP ,  and RVT ,  when stored on Fusion 360 ,  cannot be viewed in this app .  
If you have viewing access rights for the document ,  the new home view is stored in the cloud and is available only to you in the Autodesk 360 app .  
If you have editing access or own the document ,  the new home view is stored in the cloud and is available to all collaborators in the Autodesk 360 app .

For model categories and annotation categories ,  you can override the project-wide settings defined for a Hidden Lines subcategory .  
Override graphics :  Select the element ,  right-click ,  and select Override Graphics in View { 1 } by Element . 
You can control the display of hidden lines throughout the project ,  in specific views ,  and by element in a view . 
This element-specific override is not affected by the Show Hidden Lines view parameter . 
Use the Show Hidden Lines tool :  To see the hidden lines of an element relative to another element ,  click View tab { 1 } Graphics panel { 2 } Show Hidden Lines .  
When creating a view template ,  you can enable the Show Hidden Lines parameter for the template . 
Whenever a view displays hidden lines ,  the software uses these styles unless you override them for the view or for specific elements . 
To change the hidden line styles used in the current view ,  use the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog .  
Define project-wide settings for hidden lines
To define hidden line styles that you can use throughout the project ,  use the Object Styles dialog .  
By default ,  the hidden lines display using the line weights ,  colors ,  and patterns defined for Hidden Lines subcategories in the Object Styles dialog . 
Use the Show Hidden Lines parameter in the plan view to display the wall opening . 
Hidden lines in systems views
In view properties ,  the Discipline parameter determines the default setting of the Show Hidden Lines parameter . 
When the  { 1 } Discipline { 2 }  parameter is set to  { 3 } Structural { 4 }  ,  by default  { 5 } Show Hidden Lines { 6 }  is turned on .  
To display hidden lines in the view ,  select  { 1 } Show Hidden Lines { 2 }  on the Properties palette . 
For example ,  show hidden lines to display structural concrete components that are obscured in a view .  
Hidden lines in architectural views and coordination views
When the  { 1 } Discipline { 2 }  parameter is set to  { 3 } Architectural { 4 }  or  { 5 } Coordination { 6 }  ,  by default  { 7 } Show Hidden Lines { 8 }  is turned off .  
To display hidden lines in a view ,  select the Show Hidden Lines view parameter ,  and on the View Control Bar make sure the view's visual style is not set to Wireframe . 
To remove hidden lines in the view ,  clear  { 1 } Show Hidden Lines { 2 }  on the Properties palette .

 ( Optional )  Click  { 1 } Open { 2 }   ( IFC Options )  to specify a template for IFC-based projects and to load an IFC Class mapping file or manually assign  { 3 } Revit { 4 }  categories to IFC classes and types . 
If you do so ,  you will no longer be able to update the host project with changes to the original IFC file . 
The software then links the IFC-based project to the host project .  
Do not attempt to directly modify the IFC-based project .  
Linking an IFC file is useful when a model has been developed using IFC-compatible software other than  { 1 } Revit { 2 }  ,  and you are not directly involved in that design process .  
That folder also contains a log file named <ifc_file> . ifc . log . html . 
For example ,  you cannot insert a door or window into an IFC-based wall ,  but you can reference the walls to define room boundaries
The software uses the IFC file to create a new  { 1 } Revit { 2 }  project named <ifc_file> . ifc . RVT ,  which is stored in the same folder as the IFC file .  
On the Manage Links dialog ,  it is listed on the Revit tab . 
However ,  you are responsible for designing other elements that reference the IFC model .  
You will not be able to make changes to the IFC model in  { 1 } Revit { 2 }  ,  but you can reference its elements .  
The IFC-based project is listed in the Project Browser under Revit Links .  
If you later change or update the original IFC file ,  the host project reflects the changes when you re-open it or reload the IFC-based project . 
For example ,  another team designed the architectural model ,  and you link its IFC file so that you can design the interior . 
To use an IFC model as a reference for additional design work ,  link the IFC file to a  { 1 } Revit { 2 }  project . 
Open the project to which you want to link the IFC file . 
 ( Optional )  Before opening an IFC file ,  do the following : 
When this option is selected  ( the default )  ,  walls are automatically joined to other walls or to columns .  
 ( Optional )  Clear  { 1 } Auto-Join Elements { 2 }  if you do not want elements to be joined automatically . 
For information about the import process ,  see the log file named <ifc_file> . ifc . log in the folder of the original IFC file . 
To use the IFC file as reference information for an existing project ,  use the Link IFC tool . 
Select a project template to use for IFC files . 
Specifies the elevation of the lowest point or plane of the foundation . 
The project can be updated to reflect later changes to the original IFC file . 
You can use information from Industry Foundation Classes  ( IFC )  files in  { 1 } ProdName { 2 }  projects . 
To use IFC files in a project ,  do one of the following
Later changes to the original IFC file are not reflected in the  { 1 } Revit { 2 }  project . 
 { 1 } Link { 2 }  the IFC file to an existing  { 3 } Revit { 4 }  project to reference its information for additional design work .  
 { 1 } Open { 2 }   ( import )  the IFC file in  { 3 } ProdName { 4 }  to create a new project that uses the IFC data as a starting point .  
Centerline is enabled on pipe fabrication parts .  
The centerline displays by default for Medium and Fine detail levels .  
 { 1 } Hidden lines and view discipline { 2 }  :  The  { 3 } Discipline { 4 }  view parameter no longer controls whether hidden lines display in a view .  
When you upgrade a project ,  Show Hidden Lines is set as follows ,  based on the Discipline setting for each view : 
on
off
However ,  it determines the default setting for the new  { 1 } Show Hidden Lines { 2 }  view parameter .  
When Discipline is set to .  .  . 
then Show Hidden Lines is .  .  .

In this case ,   @ 5<45<15 specifies a point relative to the previous point . 
For example ,  5<45<15 specifies a point relative to the previous point . 
If you turn off dynamic input ,  you specify relative coordinates with the  @  sign as a prefix and no prefix to enter absolute coordinates .  
By default ,  when you enter coordinates in the cursor tooltip with dynamic input turned on  ( F12 )  ,  you specify relative coordinates with no prefix ,  and absolute coordinates with the  { 1 } # { 2 }  prefix .  
In the illustration below ,  dynamic input is turned off ,  so 5<45<15 indicates a point 5 units from the UCS origin in the  { 1 } XY { 2 }  plane ,  45 degrees from the positive  { 3 } X { 4 }  axis in the  { 5 } XY { 6 }  plane ,  and 15 degrees up from the  { 7 } XY { 8 }  plane .

Drawing views created by a newer version of AutoCAD cannot be edited by an older version of AutoCAD .  
You cannot edit any drawing view properties ,  add new drawing views or update any drawing views in that drawing file . 
For example ,  drawing views created by AutoCAD 2014 cannot be edited in AutoCAD 2013 ,  even though both versions of AutoCAD save to the same  ( AutoCAD 2013 )  file format .

Press CTRL while dragging viewport boundaries to display the green splitter bar and create new viewports .  
Model space viewports should not be confused with  { 1 } layout viewports { 2 }  ,  which are available only in paper space and are used to arrange views of your drawing on a sheet . 
After you create a new viewport ,  you might want to maximize and center the view by double-clicking the mouse wheel to perform a zoom extents . 
Drag the boundaries of viewports to adjust their size . 
Errors that you might miss in one view might be visible in another . 
Choose from several viewport configurations by clicking the [+] or [-] control in the top-left corner of a viewport . 
When you display multiple viewports ,  the one that is highlighted with a blue rectangle is called the  { 1 } current viewport { 2 }  . 
You can start a command in one viewport and finish it in a different viewport . 
Drag a viewport boundary onto another boundary to remove a viewport . 
You can make any viewport the current one by clicking in it . 
Alternatively ,  you can drag the outermost splitter controls . 
You can save and restore viewport configurations by name with the VPORTS command . 
You can modify the size ,  shape ,  and number of model space viewports in a viewport configuration : 
Commands that create or modify an object are started in the current viewport ,  but the results apply to the model and can be visible in other viewports . 
Commands that control the view ,  such as panning and zooming ,  apply only to the current viewport .

Applies only to legacy  ( pre-2015 )  point cloud objects . 
When you store a drawing in your online Autodesk 360 account ,  the associated design feed data and any associated images are stored securely in Autodesk 360 . 
For example ,  if you plan to make copies of a drawing at various stages in the design process ,  and you want to freeze the design feed at each stage ,  it is recommended that you use Save As rather than the operating system to copy the drawing file . 
Unlike saving drawings in your Autodesk 360 account ,  authorized access to the drawings is managed only by the permissions set by the server . 
If you use email ,  eTransmit ,  or FTP to send a copy of a drawing file to the people with whom you want to share your drawing ,  they will be able to view your design feed data ,  however ,  the drawing file will not be synced with any changes that you might make later on . 
If you subsequently save a local drawing to your Autodesk 360 account ,  the design feed data for that drawing will be automatically cleared by default .  
Duplicating Local Drawing Files
The Design Feed palette provides a way of adding messages and images to a drawing ,  which you can then share with colleagues ,  clients ,  and consultants online through Autodesk 360 . 
The intent of this feature is to enable you to start fresh ,  once you transfer your drawing file to your AutoCAD 360 account for collaboration . 
In this case ,  the design feed data for these drawings are still stored in Autodesk 360 ,  but the association to the design feed data is maintained by a unique  { 1 } design feed ID { 2 }  ,  which is saved in the drawing . 
As an alternative to storing drawing files in your Autodesk 360 account ,  you can store them locally on your computer's hard drive .  
Autodesk 360 is designed primarily to facilitate sharing your drawing files online and collaborating with design feed .  
Your authorized colleagues ,  clients ,  and consultants can still access local drawing files and associated design feeds ,  provided the following conditions are met : 
They can access the drawing file on your local hard drive ,  most likely through a server
In the example below ,  the post was associated with a specified area and indicated with a numbered bubble that corresponds to the number of the post . 
They have an Autodesk 360 account
In this case ,  anyone with an Autodesk 360 account and who has access to the server can access the design feed associated with each drawing .  
In some circumstances ,  this duplication of local design feed IDs between drawings might not be desirable .  
Also ,  the person who created a design feed post can delete the post . 
The design feed is updated automatically several times a minute .

Next ,  adjust the Extension 1  ( or 2 )   { 1 }  and Start  ( or End )  Cutback  { 2 }  instance properties to specify the cutback for both cut-end beams .  
When the I-beam family type changes ,  the cutback between the 2 beams increases .  
In this instance ,  the I-beam is framed into the 2 beams using the Beam/Column Join tool . 
The Show Hidden Lines tool on the ribbon provides an override for the graphic display of individual elements in the current view .  
To show hidden lines for obscured elements in the view by category ,  select the Show Hidden Lines parameter in view properties . 
 ( Optional )  To display hidden lines for multiple elements ,  on the Options Bar ,  select Multiple Selection  ( the default )  . 
The following example illustrates the results after using Show Hidden Lines and selecting the 4x6 stud and a bolt .  
To change the hidden line style for the element category ,  use the Visibility/Graphics tool . 
 ( Optional )  To reverse the effects of this tool ,  change the visual style to Wireframe ,  and click View tab { 1 } Graphics panel { 2 }   ( Remove Hidden Lines )  . 
Linking an IFC file is useful when a model has been developed using IFC-compatible software other than  { 1 } Revit { 2 }  ,  and you are responsible for designing elements in  { 3 } Revit { 4 }  that reference the IFC model .  
Enchancements for Revit Server include : 
You can initiate collaboration in the cloud and save your Revit model in an Autodesk 360 project .  
In view properties for 2D views ,  the Discipline parameter determines the default setting of the Show Hidden Lines parameter ,  but you can change its value as desired for each view . 
On the View Control Bar ,  make sure the view's visual style is not set to Wireframe . 
To display hidden lines in a view ,  select the Show Hidden Lines view parameter .  
For structural elevation views and all 3D views ,  by default  { 1 } Show Hidden Lines { 2 }  is turned off . 
When the  { 1 } Discipline { 2 }  parameter for a 2D view or a 3D view is set to  { 3 } Architectural { 4 }  or  { 5 } Coordination { 6 }  ,  by default  { 7 } Show Hidden Lines { 8 }  is turned off .  
For all 3D views  ( regardless of discipline )  ,  the Show Hidden Lines parameter is turned off by default . 
For all 3D views ,  by default  { 1 } Show Hidden Lines { 2 }  is turned off . 
To copy a fabrication configuration that is already on a server ,  select it ,  and click  { 1 }   ( Save As )  . 
Used in conjunction with the Building Story parameter when exporting to IFC with the export option  { 1 } Split walls and columns by level { 2 }  .  
The default setting for hidden lines in 2D views depends on the Discipline view parameter . 
To display the wall opening in the plan view ,  select the Show Hidden Lines parameter . 
By default ,  hidden lines are turned off in all 3D views .

You can upload or download fabrication configurations to or from a  ( cloud )  server ,  or remove a configuration from a  ( cloud  ) server .  
Link IFC :  To link an IFC file to the current project ,  use the new Link IFC tool on the Insert tab . 
You can now display hidden lines in 3D views . 
This parameter can also be set for view templates .  
In view properties ,  use the new Show Hidden Lines parameter to turn on hidden lines for the current view .  
This parameter also determines the default value for the Show Hidden Lines parameter .  
Some typical legends include the following :

How do I exit Duo Sketch?
If both of you have continued sketching during this period { 1 }  ,  we recommend you both use xx to save a copy of the file locally to your device .  
Then ,  use xx  { 1 } Chat  { 2 } to { 3 }   { 4 } determine whether one of you will sync up with the other or clear the layer and start fresh { 5 }  { 6 }  . 
If someone continued sketching during this period { 1 }  ,  we recommend that the other person taps xx to sync their canvas with the modified one .  { 2 } 
Tap xx ,  then  { 1 } Exit { 2 }  to stop the sharing and closes the session . 
What do we do if we are disconnected?
If neither of you changed your sketch { 1 }  ,  tap xx to sync your canvases and continue working .  { 2 } 
Tap xx and yy  { 1 } Connect { 2 }  to reconnect .  
Once reconnected ,  we recommend you use xx  { 1 } Chat  { 2 } to see if either of you have made any changes to the canvas while disconnected .

Ensure the precision required for your models . 
There are several precision features available ,  including
For example ,  if the second point of a line needs to be created at a 45 degree angle ,  you would enter <45 in the Command window . 
Review the basic AutoCAD controls . 
To line up the dimension lines point 3 was snapped to the endpoint of the previously created dimension line . 
To open the Dimension Style Manager ,  click the indicated button .  
You can create horizontal and vertical dimensions with the DIMLINEAR command .  
The default dimension style is named either Standard  ( imperial )  or ISO-25  ( metric )  .  
Simply click two diagonal points for the rectangle as illustrated .  
In some 2D drawings ,  it can be convenient to click ,  drag ,  and rotate the UCS to change the origin point ,  and the horizontal and vertical directions . 
Another method ,  one that you will often use when you don't want to add numbers together ,  requires two steps .  
You start the COPY command and select the circle as shown . 
You can use two points specified anywhere in your model . 
The result is that the lines are extended to the boundary . 
For example ,  this model might be a gasket or the design for a public park . 
To shorten the model by a specified amount ,  you'd move your cursor to the left instead . 
Creating them is easy and efficient with the OFFSET command .  
Let's say that you want to make more copies of the circle at the same horizontal distance .  
Click the OFFSET tool or enter O in the Command window . 
Enhance 3D Performance
After you create a multileader ,  select it and then modify it by clicking and moving its grips . 
Click the Multileader tool in the Annotation panel or enter MLD in the Command window .  
To create a multileader ,  use the MLEADER command .  
This will save you a lot of time by making them available in all new drawings . 
Feel free to experiment . 
You can easily move and rotate this block using this grip . 
In this example ,  you would probably create a new block definition from the objects in the exploded block . 
After inserting the block ,  you can select it and a grip appears .  
In the following example ,  a drawing file is inserted into the current drawing to provide a standard detail view . 
With several layout viewports ,  you can display several views of model space at the same or at different scales . 
Move the layout viewport as needed ,  and adjust its edges using grips . 
In a layout ,  when model space is active ,  you can pan and zoom ,  and anything else that you could do on the Model tab . 
Print the drawing to paper or as DWF or PDF files . 
You can also specify different linetypes and line widths for display in paper space . 
Associate objects by their function or location
Enforce linetype ,  color ,  and other property standards for each layer
Freezing layers is similar to turning them off ,  but improves performance in very large drawings .

In the dashboard ,  you can open an empty drawing file based on a drawing template file ,  or an existing drawing file ,  or continue working on the previous file . 
When AutoCAD starts ,  dashboard is displayed .  
To Insert a Geographic Marker in Model Space
Typically ,  you insert a geographic marker by specifying its geographic location on a map and picking the corresponding point in model space . 
COMPLEXLTPREVIEW

The map below is shown zoomed out . 
As such ,  the resolution of the map changes automatically as you zoom in and out . 
landmark
In such a case ,  you can use the GEOMAPRESOLUTION system variable to override the map resolution ,  and thereby display a different satellite image . 
This is because the satellite image for the zoomed in resolution was taken at an earlier date ,  when the swimming pool was not yet constructed .  
The image shown below is a zoomed in image of the same location shown above .  
By default ,  the program selects the optimal resolution for the map based on the display resolution of your screen and the zoom level .  
FAQ :  Why do some objects on the online map look different when I zoom?
Sometimes ,  as you zoom ,  some buildings and landmarks on the aerial style map look different at varying zoom levels . 
disappear
Note that the swimming pool shown in the previous image is not visible when you zoom in .  
In other cases ,  it displays a different satellite image which was taken at a different date and a slightly different angle . 
In some cases ,  the map displays the same source image at a higher resolution .  
As you zoom in ,  the map changes to an image taken at a higher resolution .  
As the host drawing has geographic information in it ,  other images with geographic information can be automatically and accurately located when attached to the host drawing . 
To Perform Shape Extraction on a Point Cloud
When COMMANDPREVIEW system variable is on ,  an interactive preview of the command outcome is shown . 
Whether the interactive outcome of active commands are previewed . 
By default ,  when you enter coordinates in the cursor tooltip with dynamic input turned on  ( F12 )  ,  you specify relative coordinates with no prefix ,  and absolute coordinates with the  { 1 } # { 2 }  prefix .  
In this case ,   @ 5<30 , 8 specifies a point relative to the previous point . 
For example ,  5<30 , 8 specifies a point relative to the previous point . 
If you turn off dynamic input ,  you specify relative coordinates with the  @  sign as a prefix and no prefix to enter absolute coordinates .  
In the illustration below ,  dynamic input is turned off ,  so 5<30 , 8 specifies a point 5 units from the UCS origin in the  { 1 } XY { 2 }  plane ,  30 degrees from the positive { 3 } X { 4 }  axis in the  { 5 } XY { 6 }  plane ,  and 8 units along the positive  { 7 } Z { 8 }  axis . 
For cylindrical coordinate entry ,  you specify a point using the following syntax : 
It is available even if you are not signed in to Autodesk 360 . 
Since the online map is a temporary graphic ,  you cannot plot the online map ,  and cannot be displayed if you are not signed in to Autodesk 360 .  
It is available even if you are not signed into Autodesk 360 .

After you are done with a group ,  it is just as easy to ungroup the objects .  
If you plan to organize and access objects in a drawing using groups ,  give the group a name with the Name option of the GROUP command .  
Objects can be members of more than one group .  
If you need to edit objects within a group ,  turn off group selection with the PICKFIRST system variable ,  or change the GROUPDISPLAYMODE system variable to use grip editing . 
The commands are GROUP and UNGROUP . 
Highlight all the objects in any group with the Object Grouping dialog box using the CLASSICGROUP command . 
Groups can be named or unnamed .  
Unnamed groups are best for temporary groupings . 
A large group significantly degrades performance . 
To only display the bounding box when the point cloud is selected ,  enter  { 1 } 1 { 2 }  . 
Or ,  click Create New Sheet Set from the Templates menu in the dashboard .

If you are working on multiple Layout tabs which get hidden  ,  right-click the Model or a Layout tab and select Dock Above Status Bar .  
You can also change the resolution of the map image by updating it with imagery of a different resolution . 
MIRROR - Map images cannot be mirrored . 
Grip Edit Behavior
ARRAY - Map images cannot be arrayed .  
Map images embed themselves at the bottom of the draw order ,  just above the online map . 
Unlike the online map ,  they neither change in resolution nor do they add or remove details .  
As such you can plot map images ,  and display them even if you are not connected to Autodesk 360 .  
Only the magnification changes . 
Similarly ,  if you move the map image by dragging the border ,  it moves and displays the underlying map imagery of that area . 
on line
grip edit
Map images are created on the current layer ,  on the WCS or on a plane parallel to the WCS .  
Map images zoom in and zoom out just like raster images .  
If you grip edit a map image while you are not connected to the Internet ,  the map image goes blank .  
As such you can edit map images only if you are signed in to Autodesk 360 . 
Map images are bounded by a rectangular border .  
About Map Images
A map image is a rectangular object that contains a cached image of a part of the online map .  
You can lock the layer containing a map image so that you cannot delete it ,  move it or resize it by accident . 
This ability lets you rectify visibility issues if the geometry on top of the map is not clearly visible against the image map . 
You can also create a map image by capturing a rectangular area on the online map .  
Visual Enhancements
Unlike the online map ,  map images are not a temporary graphics .  
Instead ,  the border expands to display more of the map imagery . 
If you rotate a map image by grip editing its border ,  it rotates and displays the underlying map imagery of the new area it covers .  
If you enlarge the map image by grip editing its border ,  the imagery does not resize .  
Anytime you change the resolution ,  the map image fetches fresh imagery from the online maps service .  
The following edit commands cannot be used on map images : 
Creating Map Images
TRIM/EXTEND - Map images cannot be trimmed or extended .  
However ,  you can use a map image border as an edge for trimming and extending other objects . 
As such you can change the resolution only if you are signed in to Autodesk 360 . 
As such ,  you can download fresh map imagery from the online maps service and update the map image on demand .  
This border behaves like a layout viewport border .  
You can control the resolution of map images to minimize pixelization during plotting .  
Map Images Versus the Online Map
on-line
Every time you grip edit a map image ,  it fetches fresh imagery from online maps service to fill the new area covered by the border .  
Typically ,  the optimal resolution for on-screen viewing is not optimal for plotting .  
As soon as you get connected to Autodesk 360 ,  the map image fetches fresh imagery from the online maps service . 
Just like the Online map ,  the map image maintains a link with the online maps service .  
You can use the IMAGEADJUST command to control the brightness ,  contrast and fade settings of map images .  
COPY/COPYCLIP - Map images cannot be copied . 
Map images embed themselves in the drawing area at the correct geographic coordinates . 
They are filtered out when you select them . 
Restrictions
GEOMAPIMAGE
restrictions
You can create a map image by capturing the online map displayed in a layout viewport or the current view on the Model tab .  
Since they are saved with the drawing ,  the imagery does not change unless you update the map image ,  or edit the map image .

A layout is a 2D environment where you can specify the size of your drawing sheet ,  add a title block ,  display multiple views of your model ,  and create dimensions and notes for your drawing . 
Typically ,  a model composed of geometric objects is created in a three-dimensional space called model space .  
The two spaces are accessible near the left bottom corner of the drawing area :  the Model tab and Layout1 and Layout2 tabs . 
There are two distinct working environments in which you can create objects in a drawing - Model space and layout space . 
A layout of specific views and annotations of this model is created in a two-dimensional space called paper space . 
You can use multiple layouts to show and provide details on the various components of your model .  
Paper space is a sheet layout environment where you can specify the size of your sheet ,  add a title block ,  display multiple views of your model ,  and create dimensions and notes for your drawing .  
You can vary the scale of the model view to show small details which are part of a bigger three-dimensional model ,  on standard-sized drawing sheets . 
The 3DORBIT command displays only the objects that you preselected . 
Controls how the target point is acquired for the 3DORBIT command . 
Sets the Orbit Auto Target option of the 3DORBIT command on or off .  
The target point is automatically centered with respect to the objects visible in the drawing area .  
This behavior also applies when you temporarily enter 3D Orbit mode by pressing Shift and the mouse wheel as you move the cursor . 
The target point is determined by where you click .  
The 3DORBIT command displays all objects ,  regardless of whether they were preselected . 
ORBITAUTOTARGET
The target point will snap to the nearest feature on an object when your cursor hovers over the object .  
ORBITAUTOTARGET  ( System Variable ) 
The target point displays temporarily as a small ,  dark sphere when you click to orbit .  
It shows you exactly how the objects will look when the command is executed .  
To Toggle Command Previewing
You can specify whether an interactive preview is displayed before the command is completed . 
About Command Preview
On the Selection tab ,  under Preview ,  select or clear Command Preview . 
The interactive preview applies to the following commands : 
The preview provides you a quick feedback of the active command .  
The same as 0 ,  except that the text input repeats automatically . 
You can preview the results of the active command . 
As you make changes within the command ,  you can instantly preview the final result . 
To change Stack Properties ,  right-click stacked text and choose Stack Properties . 
For example ,  if you enter  { 1 } 1#3 { 2 }  followed by a nonnumeric character or space ,  the result is  { 3 } 1/3 { 4 }  . 
The method used for locating the target point is determined by the ORBITAUTOTARGET system variable . 
The target point displays temporarily as a small ,  dark sphere .  
Controls automatic correction for MTEXT and TEXT/DTEXT when CAPS LOCK is active . 
ON - Autocorrect is enabled

About Framing Element Offsets
Click a characteristic point or line from which the framing element geometry will justify . 
Only one element may be selected
In most cases ,  nine colored lines representing the justification options display along the beam .  
Independently justified elements cannot be modified with the Characteristic Points tool .  
Click Modify | Structural Framing tab  { 1 }  Justification panel  { 2 }  Characteristic Points . 
Channel beams and L-beams possess different family origins and geometrical centers and as a result have different characteristic points . 
If the Characteristic Points tool is unavailable ,  verify the following : 
If the tool is not available ,  be sure that the yz Justification parameter for the framing element is specified as Uniform in the Properties palette . 
 { 1 } Blue { 2 }  :  Origin characteristic lines at the top ,  bottom ,  left ,  and right of the framing element .

If your hard drive becomes full or you experience issues with models and/or links ,  one possible solution is to delete your local cache . 
Within this folder ,  there are subfolders for each Autodesk ID .  
The folder names are GUIDs and it is difficult to determine which folder belongs to which model .  
Troubleshooting :  Delete Local Cache
Within each Autodesk ID folder ,  there are subfolders organized by model .  
The local cache is located in C : \Users\<Windows Username>\AppData\Local\Autodesk\Revit\Autodesk Revit 2015\CollaborationCache .

Select a new justification direction in the drawing area without adjusting parameter values in Properties palette .  
You can now disallow auto-join behavior to position structural framing elements in an as-built condition .  
You can now quickly offset the physical geometry of framing elements using the Offset y and Offset z justification tools .  
Fine adjustments are now possible working directly in the drawing area without manually calculating and typing parameter values in Properties palette .  
By default ,  each end of structural framing elements has joining activated by an instance property .  
You can now quickly change the justification of the physical geometry of a framing element using the Characteristic Points tool .

For each view ,  you can change the value of the Show Hidden Lines view parameter from <By discipline> to All or None ,  making the display of hidden lines independent of the Discipline parameter . 
The new Show Hidden Lines view parameter is set to <By discipline> for all views ,  so that  { 1 } Revit { 2 }  controls hidden lines according to the Discipline parameter .  
The internal family related data restructuring improves overall performance and will slightly increase the project file size . 
 { 1 } Family Restructuring in Project Upgrades { 2 }  :  When you upgrade a project ,  each family loaded in the project  ( including system families )  is restructured .  
This is a one-time process for each project if the project is saved .

For example ,  you cannot insert a door or window into an IFC-based wall ,  but you can create dimensions that reference the walls . 
If the current file has a newer timestamp or different file size ,   { 1 } Revit { 2 }  uses the IFC GUIDs to match entities in the IFC file with elements in the  { 3 } Revit { 4 }  model . 
In the host model ,  the original IFC file is listed in the following locations :

 { 1 } Anchor Profile To Alignment Start { 2 }  :  Locks the profile to the alignment start .  
 { 1 } Anchor Profile Geometry Points To Alignment Geometry Points { 2 }  :  Locks each profile geometry point to the previous alignment geometry point .  
If you select this option ,  you can also select the  { 1 } Notify Which Entities Are Affected { 2 }  option ,  which adds a graphical marker to the drawing to highlight the modified profile entities . 
When the alignment geometry changes ,  the layout profile geometry is broken at the nearest vertical geometry point that is outside the affected region .  
If the alignment changes ,  the elevation of the profile geometry point is maintained and entities are modified or deleted as needed . 
When you are working in PVI mode ,  notifications are not displayed in the Profile Entities vista . 
The appearance of the  { 1 } Notification Symbol { 2 }  can be controlled by modifying the  { 3 } profile style { 4 }  . 
This option preserves portions of a layout profile that are not affected by a change to the horizontal geometry .  
If you select this option ,  you can also select one of the following options : 
Specifies how the layout profile geometry is anchored in relation to the associated alignment . 
A warning icon is displayed at each broken geometry point
If the horizontal alignment changes ,  the profile does not change ,  and stays locked to the alignment start station . 
This will keep all the vertical geometry that you designed ,  but may leave gaps in the regions that were affected by the horizontal changes .  
Use this tab to specify options for anchoring the profile to the alignment .

The  { 1 } Extract Corridor Solids { 2 }  command ,  which was formerly in the Toolbox ,  has been added to the ribbon . 
Options are now available for controlling  { 1 } how layout profile geometry is anchored { 2 }  in relation to the associated alignment .  
You can now  { 1 } change the constraint types { 2 }  of profile sub-entities in the Profile Layout Parameters dialog box . 
You can now use Properties palette to change the object reference that is used in  { 1 } alignment station offset labels { 2 }  ,   { 3 } surface slope labels { 4 }  ,   { 5 } surface spot elevation labels { 6 }  ,  and  { 7 } surface contour labels { 8 }  .  
This command is intended to provide backwards-compatibility with previous versions of the application . 
Previously ,  an object selection button was available for selecting a different reference text object . 
The features in the Autodesk AutoCAD Civil 3D 2014 Productivity Pack 1 have been integrated . 
You can now use a mid-ordinate distance to determine the  { 1 } frequency to insert assemblies { 2 }  along curved baselines and curved offset targets .  
The Export Civil 3D Drawing command for exporting  { 1 } DWG { 2 }  and  { 3 } DGN { 4 }  files has been integrated and is now available on the ribbon .  
When you replace a subassembly in an assembly ,  you now have the option of  { 1 } retaining the existing corridor targets { 2 }  that are similar . 
You can now specify that  { 1 } sample lines are incremented { 2 }  relative to the start of the station range . 
When you use this option ,  the elevation of the profile geometry point is maintained and entities are modified or deleted as needed if the alignment changes . 
Integration of Autodesk AutoCAD Civil 3D 2014 Productivity Pack 1
You can now use a drop-down list in the Properties palette to change reference text objects for label types that support reference text objects .  
If you change the object that is referenced in the label ,  question marks  ( ??? )  may appear in the label .  
The manner in which the actual sight distance is calculated  ( as reported in the sight distance report )  has changed ,  and the graphics created in the drawing to illustrate the sight distance features have changed . 
Autodesk { 1 }  Vault  { 2 } support for pressure networks { 3 }  has been integrated . 
When you project a solid to profile view ,  the projection can now be created to represent the solid exactly where the alignment crosses it by selecting the Section check box in the  { 1 } projection style { 2 }  . 
New options are available for creating free vertical curves .  
Previously ,  the labels had to be deleted and recreated if you wanted to change the object that was being referenced in the label . 
Changes have been made in Autodesk AutoCAD Civil 3D 2014 SP1 and Autodesk AutoCAD Civil 3D 2015 to the  { 1 } Check Sight Distance { 2 }  command .  
The user interface has been updated so that some of the settings are in a new Export Settings dialog box . 
You can also use a setting to insert assemblies adjacent to the start and end of offset targets . 
A new command is available for  { 1 } converting a free vertical curve { 2 }  that was created using a pass through point as its constraint type to a curve that uses length as its constraint type .  
 { 1 } 3D areas for corridors { 2 }  can now be reported in a quantity takeoff report . 
For example ,  this may occur if you select a different surface to label in a surface spot elevation label ,  and label is not located within the extents of that surface . 
Autodesk { 1 }  AutoCAD { 2 }  Civil 3D { 3 }  2015 contains the following new features and enhancements . 
You can now specify an option to lock profile geometry points to the previous alignment geometry points ,  or to the alignment start .  
Options are now available for  { 1 } staggering corridor point code labels { 2 }  in section views . 
The ability to create  { 1 } sliced solids of pipe networks in section views { 2 }  has been integrated . 
You can now create an entity-based  { 1 } free circular vertical curve or a free parabolic vertical curve { 2 }  by selecting a pass through point in the drawing . 
However ,  the  { 1 } Computation Type { 2 }  setting calculates 3D areas only for corridors ;  it does not apply to other  { 3 } AutoCAD Civil 3D { 4 }  objects . 
You can also specify the  { 1 } Computation Type { 2 }  setting in the  { 3 } Quantity Takeoff Command Settings { 4 }  dialog box .  
To access the Quantity Takeoff Command Settings dialog box ,  click  { 1 }  in the QTO Manager vista . 
Open a drawing that contains a corridor for which you want to calculate 3D areas of quantities . 
Prior to version 2015 of the application ,  this setting was titled Length Computation Type and it did not apply to areas . 
Specify the desired options and click  { 1 } Compute { 2 }  . 
This setting now applies to lengths as well as areas .  
In the  { 1 } Edit Command Settings - Takeoff { 2 }  dialog box ,  expand  { 3 } Compute Takeoff Options { 4 }  . 
In the Corridor Properties dialog box ,  on the  { 1 } Codes { 2 }  tab ,  edit the  { 3 } Code Set Style { 4 }  to assign quantity takeoff items to the corridor links .  
Quantities reported in area units are reported as 3D areas . 
You can calculate a 3D area based on corridor links by specifying a setting in the QuantityTakeoff command settings . 
To Calculate the 3D Area of Corridor Links
 { 1 } Workflow :  To Create Plan/Profile Sheets { 2 } 
Free vertical curves that use a pass through point must be converted back to a format that is recognizable in previous versions of the application .  
To Change the Constraint Type of Free Vertical Curves from Pass Through to Length
This command converts the constraint type of all relevant curves at once . 
This command is intended to provide backwards-compatibility with previous versions of the application  ( version 2014 and earlier )  .  
If you do not convert the curve ,  the profile geometry will be invalid in previous versions of the application . 
You can convert free vertical curves which use a pass through point as their constraint type to curves that use length as their constraint type .  
All free vertical curves which use a pass through point as their constraint type are changed to use length as their constraint type . 
On the  { 1 } Profile Layout Tools { 2 }  toolbar ,  click  { 3 } Convert Free Vertical Curve  ( Pass Through )  { 4 }  . 
To dismiss all notifications
Specify the anchoring settings and click  { 1 } OK { 2 }  .

Changes to the Check Sight Distance Command
Changes have been made in  { 1 } AutoCAD Civil 3D { 2 }  2014 SP1 and  { 3 } AutoCAD Civil 3D { 4 }  2015 to the Check Sight Distance command .  
An obstructed area block  ( not shown below )  was also created in the area covered by the obstructed sight lines . 
Now when an obstruction is encountered ,  the command reports the actual sight distance  ( "3" in the illustration below )  as the distance along the alignment between the eye  ( "1" in the illustration below )  and the furthest point of visibility along the alignment towards the target  ( "2" in the illustration below )  . 
When an obstruction is encountered ,  the sight line graphics are now drawn in the manner shown below ,  and an obstructed area block is no longer created in the drawing . 
Previous Behavior
The manner in which the actual sight distance is calculated  ( as reported in the sight distance report )  has changed ,  and the graphics created in the drawing to illustrate the sight distance features have changed . 
A visible sight line  ( shown in green below )  was drawn from the eye to the obstruction ,  and an obstructed sight line  ( shown in red below )  was drawn starting where the obstruction began and ending at the target point .  
In previous versions of the application ,  when an obstruction was encountered ,  the command reported the actual sight distance  ( "3" in the illustration below )  as the distance between the eye  ( "1" in the illustration below )  and the obstruction ,  using the line of sight between the eye and the target  ( "2" in the illustration below )  .

About Stand-Alone Licenses
If you reinstall your Autodesk product on the same computer ,  the license remains valid ,  without the need for reactivation . 
single user license
Hard disk or file system
Display or graphics card
This occurs because each time a stand-alone product is launched ,  the system checks a number of attributes of the computer and compares these with values in the trusted storage file .  
Explains single ,  multi-seat ,  trial licenses ,  and the license file . 
trial license
single license
To prevent a validation failure when changing hardware ,  use the License Transfer Utility to export the license from the computer before the change ,  and then import the license back to the computer after the change . 
The need for license reactivation can also be triggered by a significant change to the computer hardware or network identity .  
BIOS serial number and version
So a change such as replacement of a hard drive or network card can require license reactivation .  
Some changes to these values are tolerated ,  but a major change results in a validation failure ,  and the license must be reactivated .  
CPU information
The stand-alone licensing process  ( including multi-seat stand-alone )  creates a license file ,  known as a trusted storage file ,  and a minor change to the computer's file system .  
Network card address
The license file and related changes remain on your computer when you uninstall your product .  
trusted storage file
The trusted storage file has a format such as  { 1 } adskflex_00691b00_tsf . data { 2 }  .

AutoCAD 2013 and later
Starting with AutoCAD 2015 ,  if your CUIx file utilizes an external resource DLL for custom images ,  a separate resource DLL should be created for each theme :  light and dark .  
The naming convention for the DLL requires you to use the same name as the customization file ,  but also requires adding the suffix "_light" or "_dark . " 
The appropriate resource DLL is used based on which theme is currently applied to the user interface .  
For example ,  if a CUIx file named  { 1 } mymenu . cuix { 2 }  is loaded ,  AutoCAD searches for the resource DLL file  { 3 } mymenu_light . dll { 4 }  when the Light theme is current or  { 5 } mymenu_dark . dll { 6 }  when the Dark theme is current . 
For AutoCAD ,  the value is "acad" and for AutoCAD the value is "aclt . "
This approach can be helpful when working with drawings that might need to be compatible with legacy releases of AutoCAD or different products .  
Varies with the product
The product might be "AutoCAD" or "AutoCAD LT . "

Starting with AutoCAD 2015 ,  if your CUIx file utilizes an external resource DLL for custom images ,  a separate resource DLL should be created for each theme :  light and dark .  
For example ,  if a CUIx file named  { 1 } mymenu . cuix { 2 }  is loaded ,  AutoCAD searches for the resource DLL file  { 3 } mymenu_light . dll { 4 }  when the Light theme is current or  { 5 } mymenu_dark . dll { 6 }  when the Dark theme is current . 
The naming convention for the DLL requires you to use the same name as the customization file ,  but also requires adding the suffix "_light" or "_dark . "

If you choose to anchor the profile geometry points to the associated alignment geometry points ,  then you can also specify whether notifications are displayed and whether profile geometry is modified or deleted when the geometry of the alignment is changed .  
You can use the  { 1 } Profile Locking { 2 }  tab in the  { 3 } Profile Properties { 4 }  dialog box to specify how the layout profile geometry is anchored in relation to the associated alignment . 
 { 1 } Anchor Profile To Alignment Start { 2 }  option locks the profile to the alignment start .  
This setting replicates the behavior that was in versions of the application prior to the 2015 version . 
The notifications also appear in the Profile Entities vista when Entity Based mode is selected in the Profile Layout Tools toolbar . 
This option preserves portions of a layout profile that are not affected by a change to the horizontal geometry . 
 { 1 } Anchor Profile To Alignment Start { 2 } 
About Anchoring Layout Profile Geometry to Alignment Geometry
When the start point of the alignment is grip-edited to the left  ( indicated by the red arrow in the illustration below )  ,  the profile is shifted to the right within the profile view to accommodate the additional length of the alignment but is otherwise unmodified . 
If the alignment changes ,  the elevation of the profile geometry point is maintained and the profile entities that are affected by the edit to the alignment are modified or deleted . 
If you choose to have notifications displayed ,  then a notification icon is displayed at each affected geometry point in the drawing .  
The original drawing is inserted as an xref so that you can see how the alignment and profile are changed by the edit .  
If the horizontal alignment changes ,  the profile geometry does not change ,  and stays locked relative to the alignment start station .  
If the profile geometry is broken to create a gap ,  it is broken at the nearest vertical geometry point that is outside the affected region . 
When the start point of the alignment is grip-edited to the left  ( indicated by the red arrow in the illustration below )  ,  the profile is modified and the modified geometry is marked with notification symbols .  
The following illustration shows an alignment  ( upper viewport )  and its associated profile  ( lower viewport )  . 
There may be situations where a solution cannot be found for the profile geometry when the alignment is edited .  
In the following example ,  the  { 1 } Anchor Profile Geometry Points To Alignment Geometry Points { 2 }  option is specified for the profile .  
The xref shows the original geometry in lighter colors . 
In this case ,  when a solution cannot be found ,  the profile entities will be deleted ,  creating gaps in the profile .  
The  { 1 } Anchor Profile Geometry Points To Alignment Geometry Points { 2 }  option locks each profile geometry point to the previous alignment geometry point .  
 { 1 } Anchor Profile Geometry Points To Alignment Geometry Points { 2 } 
In the following example ,  the  { 1 } Anchor Profile To Alignment Start { 2 }  option is selected .

Optionally ,  change the  { 1 } Parameter Constraint Lock { 2 }  value back to  { 3 } True { 4 }  . 
Use the  { 1 } Profile Layout Properties { 2 }  dialog box to edit the vertical curve values as needed . 
On the  { 1 } Profile Layout Tools { 2 }  toolbar ,  click the following options : 
Change the  { 1 } Parameter Constraint Lock { 2 }  value to  { 3 } False { 4 }  . 
To Change the Constraint Type of a Free Parabolic or Circular Vertical Curve
In the  { 1 } Profile Layout Properties { 2 }  dialog box ,  do the following : 
Change the  { 1 } Constraint Type Desc { 2 }  value to a different constraint . 
When  { 1 } Entity Based { 2 }  is selected in the  { 3 } Profile Layout Tools { 4 }  ,  you can unlock and change the constraint type of free parabolic or circular vertical curves in the  { 5 } Profile Layout Parameters { 6 }  dialog box . 
Click the vertical curve in the drawing to select it . 
Unlocking and changing the constraint type is supported for free circular and parabolic vertical curves that are created with the  { 1 } Free Vertical Curve  ( Parabolic )  { 2 }  ,   { 3 } Free Vertical Parabola  ( PVI Based )  { 4 }  ,   { 5 } Free Vertical Curve  ( Circular )  { 6 }  and  { 7 } Free Circular Curve  ( PVI Based )  { 8 }  commands . 
To Extend Fixed and Floating Profile Entities
The extensions are created as AutoCAD entities . 
When a fixed tangent or curve is extended ,  extensions are created on both ends of the entity . 
When a floating tangent or curve is extended ,  an extension is created on the floating end of the entity . 
Extensions are not supported for free tangents or curves . 
You can extend fixed and floating profile entities to the extents of the profile view .  
If you do not convert the curves ,  the curves will be missing when the drawing is opened in previous versions of the application . 
You can convert free vertical curves  ( created with the Free Vertical Curve  ( Circular )  command or the Free Vertical Curve  ( Parabolic )  command )  which use a pass through point as their constraint type to curves that use length as their constraint type .  
Free vertical curves created with the Free Vertical Curve  ( Circular )  command or the Free Vertical Curve  ( Parabolic )  that use a pass through point must be converted to a format that is recognizable in these previous versions of the application .

If no entities exist in the drawing at coordinates that are within the coordinate system ,  you can use the Zoom Center option to zoom to a coordinate that is approximately in the center of the coordinate system . 
If entities already exist in the drawing at coordinates that are within the coordinate system ,  you can use the Zoom Extents or Zoom All options .  
To Find Connected Pipes with Stop Conditions
Extensions are added to the ends of the selected profile entity to which entities are not already attached . 
When a fixed tangent or curve is extended ,  extensions are created on both ends of the entity if no other entities are attached to the ends .  
If grid padding is specified in the profile view style ,  the entities are extended to the edge of the grid padding rather than to the extents of the profile view . 
You can extend the geometry of fixed and floating profile entities within a profile view .  
If an entity is already attached to the end of a fixed tangent or curve ,  an extension is not created at that end . 
You can control the appearance of the extensions by modifying the  { 1 } Line Extensions { 2 }  and  { 3 } Parabolic Curve Extensions { 4 }  component display options on the  { 5 } Display { 6 }  tab of the Profile Style dialog box . 
If an entity is already attached to the floating end of a floating tangent or curve ,  an extension is not created . 
Extensions are not supported for free tangents or curves because both ends of free entities are connected to other entities . 
When a floating tangent or curve is extended ,  an extension is created on the floating end of the entity if no other entities are attached to that end .  
If there is no  { 1 } grid padding { 2 }  specified in the profile view style ,  the entities are extended to the extents of the profile view .

Minimum radii for non-superelevated roads were added . 
Two additional design criteria files are supplied with  { 1 } AutoCAD Civil 3D 2015 { 2 }  : 
Autodesk Civil 3D Imperial  ( 2011 )  Roadway Design Standards . xml
These files are installed to the following folder by default :  C : \ProgramData\Autodesk\C3D  { 1 } 2015 { 2 } \<language>\Data\Corridor Design Standards\<units> . 
All numeric values were taken from  { 1 } A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets { 2 }  ,  6th Edition ,  2011 ,  commonly referred to as the "Green Book , " published by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials  ( AASHTO )  .

You will see this change for any study from a previous release that is opened in this release ,  and that was prepared for overmolding using these property types . 
Both this method ,  and the recommended workflow ,  have been supported for several years ,  but this has created the potential for confusion . 
The historical method for preparing for an overmolding analysis is being obsoleted .  
To prepare for this ,  the  { 1 } Overmolding second component  ( 3D )  { 2 }  property has been renamed  { 3 } Legacy overmolding second component  ( 3D )   :  obsolete { 4 }  ,  and the  { 5 } Hot runner for overmolding second component  ( 3D )  { 6 }  property has been renamed  { 7 } Legacy hot runner for overmolding second component  ( 3D )   :  obsolete { 8 }  .  
However ,  if your model uses these legacy property types ,  we recommend that you change them to Part  ( 3D )  or Hot runner  ( 3D )  as appropriate .  
 { 1 }  Legacy elements  { 2 } 
The recommended workflow when preparing for an overmolding analysis ,  is to assign  { 1 } 1st shot { 2 }  or  { 3 } 2nd shot { 4 }  to the relevant model elements ,  on the  { 5 } Overmolding Component { 6 }  tab of the relevant property dialog . 
The 2015 release will support these legacy property types ,  and the analysis will run ,  with warnings .  
Historically ,  it has been possible to prepare for an overmolding analysis using the tetrahedral element type  { 1 } Overmolding second component  ( 3D )  { 2 }  for the part and  { 3 } Hot runner for overmolding second component  ( 3D )  { 4 }  for hot runners .  
Support for these legacy element property types is not expected beyond this release .

Commands for Providing Performance Feedback
This command provides a way to record product performance issues . 
PMSTART  ( Command ) 
Turns on the Performance Monitor . 
You will continue to be able to open password-protected files . 
The ability to add a password to a drawing will be removed in the next release because it does not meet contemporary security standards .  
This information along with the information that you provide in a performance questionnaire is sent to Autodesk . 
This tool will NOT collect or use information that is not potentially relevant to the analysis of the problem that you've encountered . 
Often the descriptions of performance problems that we receive can be vague or lack the system information necessary for diagnosis .  
You must have an internet connection and be logged in to Autodesk 360 to submit your report . 
PMTOGGLE
To avoid a Windows User Account Control message ,  run the program under an account with administrator privileges . 
The Performance Feedback tool enables you to record and send a log file and detailed system information to the AutoCAD performance team for analysis while you recreate a performance problem . 
In this case ,  "performance" means program behavior that is slow ,  unresponsive ,  jumpy ,  or generally not as responsive as you would expect .  
The information that you provide is used specifically for the purpose of fixing software problems : 
crash
When you encounter a problem that you can recreate ,  you can record system events and detailed system information with the PMTOGGLE command ,  which turns the recording on and off .  
The information that you provide enables Autodesk software engineers more easily find a solution . 
About Providing Performance Feedback

Powerful drafting tools
Familiar AutoCAD interface
AutoCAD Mechanical engineering software supports ANSI ,  BSI ,  CSN ,  DIN ,  GB ,  ISO ,  JIS ,  and GOST drafting environments .  
With automatic dimensioning ,  you can create multiple dimensions with minimal input ,  resulting in instant groups of ordinate ,  parallel ,  or symmetric items that are appropriately spaced .  
Select dimensions ,  and you can insert symbols ,  add or modify fits and tolerances ,  add prefix or suffix text ,  and modify precision while seeing a real-time preview .  
Create dimensions using abbreviated dialog boxes . 
Create associative section and detail views of 3D models . 
Automatic mapping and template setup .  
Detail views include full control of shape ,  scale ,  and annotations .  
With multiple diameters along a shaft selected ,  applying an h6 fit applies the tolerance to each dimension ,  based on the nominal size . 
Dimension input can even drive and change design geometry to fit certain sizes . 
Import other formats ,  including SolidWorks ,  Pro/ENGINEER ,  CATIA ,  Rhino ,  and NX applications .  
Change a design once ,  and updates ripple through the entire mechanical drawing to keep everyone on schedule ,  reducing costly stops in production from incorrect part counting ,  identification ,  and ordering . 
With leader note capabilities in AutoCAD Mechanical and features such as Holes and Extract Thread Data ,  AutoCAD Mechanical is a powerful documentation solution for mechanical design . 
In addition ,  bill of materials  ( BOM )  setup is easier with automatic mapping of BOM properties and automatic creation of migration templates . 
Deliver standards-based design documentation .  
Export or link BOM data to manufacturing resource planning  ( MRP )  ,  enterprise resource planning  ( ERP )  ,  or data management systems ,  such as  { 1 } Vault data management software { 2 }  . 
Create automated part lists and BOMs .  
AutoCAD Mechanical engineering software includes support for multiple parts lists for each drawing ,  collapsible assemblies ,  automatic recognition of standard parts ,  and customizable options so that features can be revised to match current company practices . 
Adhering to a standard environment helps improve team communication and drive consistent production results .  
Smart dimensioning tools force overlapping dimensions to automatically space themselves appropriately while integrating tolerance and fit list information into the mechanical design .  
Select multiple dimensions at once .  
AutoCAD Mechanical also includes drafting tools for creating standards-based surface texture symbols ,  geometric dimensioning and tolerances ,  datum identifiers and targets ,  notes ,  taper and slope symbols ,  and weld symbols . 
The power dimension in-place editor includes the ability to select multiple dimensions at once . 
View images and demo videos that show how AutoCAD Mechanical engineering software can enable easier documentation of drawings . 
It is especially important for the designer ,  as well as for manufacturing . 
Accurate documentation is critical to the success of your mechanical engineering designs .

Documentation for mechanical engineering
Mechanical Engineering Features | AutoCAD Mechanical
AutoCAD Mechanical engineering software provides several valuable documentation capabilities . 
Intelligent tools in AutoCAD Mechanical engineering software simplify drawing documentation .  
It is especially important for the designer ,  as well as for manufacturing .  
When you are dealing with machinery that contains hundreds or thousands of parts ,  it could take days ,  or even weeks ,  to draw them all from scratch .  
Add custom parts to content library .  
Many of these mechanical drafting tools have the intelligence that helps users easily re-edit features without having to remove and re-create the original feature .  
Surface indication leaders enable these symbols to be attached to edges and remain associative to objects ,  but originate from a surface or face . 
Part publishing enhancements make all features that previously applied only to standard parts now available for custom parts . 
Geometrically and dimensionally constrain objects .  
More than 30 options for rectangle ,  arc ,  and circle creation
Mechanical drafting standards update
Users can now add custom parts to the existing content library to share within their organization .  
Functions such as placing items on the correct layer ,  with correct color and linetype ,  enable you to differentiate your drawings . 
Automatically place items on the correct layer . 
Extended draw toolbar .  
Specific tools for mechanical drafting .  
This means you’ll spend less time and effort updating your 2D designs . 
AutoCAD Mechanical provides additional mechanical drawing and drafting options beyond what’s available in AutoCAD . 
Hidden lines
Automatically redraw hidden lines . 
Parts and features for mechanical drawings .  
When you insert content ,  AutoCAD Mechanical intelligently cleans up the surrounding geometry so you don’t have to edit it manually . 
Specialty lines for breakout views and section lines
AutoCAD Mechanical includes shaft ,  spring ,  belt ,  chain ,  and cam generators . 
Identical parts can have different geometrical appearances when in hide situations .  
Hidden lines automatically update when changes occur ,  virtually eliminating time-consuming manual redrawing of geometry due to iterative changes . 
Ramp up your productivity by defining simple foreground and background selections that automatically redraw geometry to show hidden or dashed lines of parts obstructed by other parts in your design .  
Layer management
Once constrained ,  rectangles remain rectangular ,  and centerlines remain in the center of circles or holes . 
A full suite of construction lines for aligning drafting views
JIS and DIN content libraries
These symbols support surface indication leaders .  
Turn on Auto Constrain ,  and geometrical constraints are inferred automatically—while creating the objects .  
Part publishing support for custom parts
Extended draw toolbar for manufacturing
AutoCAD Mechanical includes enhancements to the ISO 1302-2002 surface texture symbols . 
You can easily customize AutoCAD Mechanical drafting software based on your company requirements .  
Save time when building mechanisms manually .  
ISO 1302-2002 surface texture symbols . 
Built into the application environment ,  these tools are helpful when making small ,  iterative changes to improve your mechanical drawing .  
Other key features include an improved Grip Snap tool and a Size-by-Drag tool . 
Automatic centerline creation and updating
They not only create parts according to your specifications ,  but they also create all the reports and calculations you need to analyze the design .  
AutoCAD Mechanical recognizes that they are still identical parts ,  if you need to change the design or get an accurate count for the parts list .  
For example ,  you can easily resize a chamfer or fillet through the original dialog box parameters by simply double-clicking the chamfer or fillet .  
Extensive content libraries for Japan/Germany . 
Tools include : 
Detail views { 1 } —Easily create linked views at different scales
You can provide intelligence to these parts by adding parametric constraints to them through an easy-to-use environment .  
Integrated live update to your Standard Parts library as revisions and new standards are made available . 
JIS  ( Japanese )  library includes G 3350 : 2009 Light Gauge Steel and JIS G 3452 : 2010 Gas Pipe standards .  
Integrated live update to your Standard Parts library as revisions and new standards are made available through Content Manager .  
Check for dissociated annotations in model space . 
Each disassociated annotation  ( such as dimension ,  leader note ,  or surface texture symbol )  is flagged by an in-canvas badge ,  which also provides access to Delete and Reassociate commands ,  giving you complete feedback on the accuracy of your documentation . 
The DIN  ( German )  library includes DIN 6917 : 1989 ,  DIN 6918 : 1990 ,  and DIN 6918A : 1990 Fasteners . 
Get live updates to your Standard Parts library and optionally ,  those within your drawings  ( video :  x . xx min .  ) 
AutoCAD Mechanical includes extensive JIS and DIN content libraries . 
 Optionally update the parts within your design to reflect the revised parts .

In Factory layout design ,  users can place the assets on the plane inferred from a set of points in a point cloud once checking “Snap to Point Cloud” snap type . 
Using Point Cloud to Improve Factory Designs
In the Point Cloud Navigator dialog box ,  click the / icon to switch off and on the visibility of the respective Point Cloud entry . 
The distance/angle from a Point Cloud to a Point Cloud plane and other geometry . 
In an assembly file ,  access the Point Cloud commands on the ribbon :  Manage tab Point Cloud panel . 
Set the density  ( level of detail )  and maximum loaded points for point cloud . 
In AutoCAD ,  the DWG file’s associated project file is used by the Factory Asset Browser to show the associated assets  ( if a library is configured in the project file )  . 
The latest release of Factory Design Suite makes it easy to align layout projects between Inventor and AutoCAD .  
By simply identifying an Inventor project file for each AutoCAD layout drawing you’re on your way to a seamless sync .  
This is a great new feature for anyone who is working with multiple layouts at once and using different asset libraries in different layouts . 
Confirm your change when the dialogue box appears ,  and your 2D drawing will sync to the 3D model using the project you’ve identified in AutoCAD . 
Enabling Cloud-based Assets
When you create a deployment installation ,  two new options are now available . 
The cloud access icon appears in red and in a disabled status . 
Cloud Assets are not shown in Asset Browser . 
In the Asset tab for Factory Options ,  the "Enable cloud-based assets" box is unchecked . 
The behavior of the two options when they are unchecked is as follows . 
Cloud assets cannot be searched in the asset browser . 
Local System Assets are not installed on the machine . 
Install local system assets
Publishing 2D Assets From AutoCAD
You also asked if you could determine during installation whether or not cloud-based assets are enabled .  
There’s plenty to check out with this new release so enjoy exploring and ,  as always ,  please be sure to let us know what you think . 
It is now so . 
This latest release of Factory Design Suite includes new customer-driven features .  
To Use the Connect and Expose Commands
Done and done .  
Working with Bill of Materials
You asked for smoother integration ,  including the ability to re-use your AutoCAD content in the Factory ;  as a result ,  you’ll find a new Create Assets command on the ribbon .  
Synching AutoCAD and Inventor Files
Enabling Cloud-based Assets
Using Point Cloud to Improve Factory Design
You pondered the expansion of Bill of Materials  ( BOM )  features to include costing and other data .  
Just click Create Assets to begin . 
Publishing 2D Assets from AutoCAD
The ribbon command makes 2D asset building ,  and publishing ,  a snap .  
With Factory Design Suite 2015 ,  you can now re-use existing AutoCAD content as Factory assets .  
Starting with an AutoCAD drawing that contains AutoCAD blocks representing a piece of equipment ,  you can now easily identify and publish these blocks as Factory assets .  
Let’s look at parameters .  
Working With Bill of Materials
You can also process BOM sub-layout files under a parent layout . 
Next ,  select the Apply Key Parameters command in the command drop-down list . 
This command takes advantage of Inventor BOM functionality so you can quickly create a list of equipment used in your Factory layout .  
When this is turned on ,  all key parameters are summarized in a single iProperty named Key Parameters . 
A new dialogue box gives you the option to make asset files ,  and sub-layout files ,  writeable for editing .  
Previously ,  these files were read-only . 
You can choose to make Inventor files writeable so you can edit your BOM .  
Check out the new Bill of Materials  ( BOM )  command on the Factory ribbon in Inventor .  
The ability to add additional information like cost ,  description or key parameters means you can use the bill of equipment to create cost rollups for your Factory layouts . 
Key parameters are now easily observable in your BOM to help you quickly differentiate between similar-looking assets . 
Now ,  invoke the BOM command . 
From the Assets tab ,  you can enable ,  or disable ,  the BOM feature that exposes key parameter data as an iProperty .  
Select the first connector on the asset . 
The new Connect command makes it easy to make changes if the automated connection wasn’t what was intended . 
Drag and drop the first connector to connect the second connector . 
Finally ,  the asset is constrained by connectors . 
The new Expose command makes it easy to make changes if the automated connection wasn’t what was intended . 
Place assets with multiple connectors and then select the Connect command . 
The new Connect command allows for manual connect connection points that are in close proximity to each other .  
Using the Expose and Connect Commands
Includes Inventor View disk requirements and pre-requisite disk requirements . 
It is easy to create nonsensical processing conditions .  
The properties are supplied in a  ( * . udm )  file format and stored in  { 1 } My Documents\My AMI xxxx Projects { 2 } \udm { 3 }  ,  where  { 4 } xxxx { 5 }  is the software version number . 
Editing the default properties database
Make any required changes in the dialog that appears ,  and click  { 1 } OK { 2 }  . 
Default properties database ,  editing  ( Procedure ) 
Default Properties database
The system default database properties can be edited . 
Click  { 1 } Edit Default Properties  { 2 }   (  { 3 } Tools tab { 4 } Databases panel { 5 } Edit Default Properties { 6 }  )  . 
It is usually safer to create a personal database with a copy of the default properties . 
The  { 1 } Properties { 2 }  dialog appears and indicates all database properties in the default udm folder . 
editing Default Properties
Take care when editing the default properties .  
Select a  { 1 } Description { 2 }  ,  and then click  { 3 } Edit { 4 }  . 
The modified parameters will now be the standard default value used in future analyses . 
The current analysis will continue without using the GPU . 
The GPU is already being used by another analysis that was started previously . 
** WARNING 202050 ** GPU is being used by another analysis . 
 { 1 } Specified flow rate { 2 }  - Specify a constant flow rate for an individual circuit . 
Select the way that is most similar to your actual system : 
Coolant control
 { 1 } Specified Reynolds number { 2 }  - A low Reynolds number  ( i . e .  below 2300 )  produces laminar flow ,  which is characterized by smooth constant fluid motion .  
The flow of water can be controlled in a variety of ways .  
To access this dialog ,  click  { 1 } Coolant Inlets  { 2 }   (  { 3 } Boundary Conditions { 4 } Cooling { 5 } Coolant Inlets { 6 }  )  ,  then select  { 7 } New { 8 }  or  { 9 } Edit { 10 }  . 
A high Reynolds number  ( i . e .  above 4000 )  ,  produces turbulent flow ,  which produces flow fluctuations that are good for heat transfer . 
The flow through the mold will always follow the path of least resistance .  
If different circuits in the mold have different geometries ,  these circuits will also have different flow resistances .  
 { 1 } Total Flow-rate  ( All Circuits )  { 2 }  - This option will show the user how the flow is distributed through each circuit if a total flow rate for the mold is specified .  
 { 1 } Specified pressure { 2 }  - Apply a fixed pressure to force flow in the circuit specified by the inlet node . 
Hence the bulk of the flow will pass through the circuits that have a lower flow resistance ,  and less flow will pass through the circuits with a higher flow resistance . 
Specify the temperature of the coolant as it enters the system . 
Define the conditions for the coolant . 
Material Quality Index
The following actions were undertaken . 
Where there is no significant change to the grade formulation ,  manufacturing conditions ,  or testing methods/standards ,  manufacturers can confirm the material data validity of their grades without the need to retest the material .  
The relative weighting of material parameters that constitute the Moldflow material quality rating was reviewed to ensure the validity of the rating was maintained . 
A new date will be entered in the  { 1 } Date Modified { 2 }  section for the relevant properties . 
A slight modification to the values of some parameters were made . 
The Age factor ,  and Viscosity data group weighting were reviewed .  
All grades that have pvT data will have the checkbox  { 1 } Data tested in cooling { 2 }  selected .  
The program has been adjusted so that all grades that have D3  ( no matter what family )  will have the checkbox  { 1 } Includes pressure-dependant data { 2 }  selected . 
Previously this was only available for grades tested by Moldflow .

 { 1 } This video demonstrates how to create a boundary sketch to define the edges of an element ,  such as a floor or roof .  
 { 1 } Use the tools on the Draw panel to create a closed-loop sketch of the object’s boundaries .  
 { 1 } In sketch mode ,  the other elements in the drawing area display in halftone and the Draw panel displays in the ribbon .  
 { 1 } Sketching is used to define many objects such as sweeps ,  openings ,  and filled regions . 
 { 1 } Make changes to the sketch using the draw tools ,  or use the modify tools to edit the existing sketch lines . 
Then ,  right-click ,  and select Hide in View . 
 { 1 } You can also turn off a category’s or element’s visibility directly in the view .  
 { 1 } Then ,  right-click ,  and select Override Graphics in View to open the Override dialog 
 { 1 } Another way to change the graphics of a category or element is by using the visibility overrides .   
 { 1 } and then click Visibility and Graphics on the Properties palette .  
 { 1 } To make a change to the visibility and graphics of a view ,  begin by making sure you have nothing selected in the view ,  
 { 1 } First ,  select the element or category .  
 { 1 } In the dialog ,  the tabs show how element categories are grouped into Model Categories ,  Annotation Categories ,  and Imported Categories .   
 { 1 } In this mode ,  you can select elements and categories and use the context menu to make them visible .  
 { 1 } To see which elements and categories are hidden in the view ,  click Reveal Hidden Elements on the View Control Bar .  
 { 1 } To turn off the visibility of a category in a view ,  clear the checkmark for that category .  
 { 1 } First ,  select an element in the view .  
 { 1 } You can change the visibility status and the appearance of each category and element in each view of the project . 
 { 1 } and make changes to the appearance of the element . 
 { 1 } You can also type the keyboard shortcut VG to display the Visibility and Graphics dialog . 
 { 1 } If you are using imported CAD files ,  the visibility of the layers of the CAD files are controlled here .   
 { 1 } As you place a level ,  snaps and guides help align the extents of the datum to existing levels in the project .  
 { 1 } When you change the name of a level ,  the corresponding views in the project are changed as well .   
 { 1 } such as the top of a parapet ,  which is used only for reference . 
 { 1 } Other level datums in the project can be used to define constraints as well . 
 { 1 } When you place walls in the entry level plan ,  the bases of the walls are constrained to the entry level datum . 
 { 1 } This video demonstrates how to place level datums to establish a framework for the project .  
 { 1 } In a section or elevation view ,  use the Level tool to place a level . 
 { 1 } Click to define each end of the level line . 
 { 1 } the bases of the walls are constrained to the lower level and the tops are constrained to the roof level .   
 { 1 } Clear this option if you are creating a reference level for which no plan views are needed ,  
 { 1 } By default ,  when you place elements in a plan view ,  each element uses the associated level datum as a base constraint .   
 { 1 } when the level is moved ,  the tops and bottoms of the walls are moved as well . 
 { 1 } Because the tops and bottoms of the walls are constrained to a level ,  
 { 1 } Top and bottom constraints establish the position of the wall in 3D space .   
 { 1 } Use controls in the drawing area to change the elevation of the level ,  or select a level and make changes on the Properties palette . 
 { 1 } By default ,  as you place a level ,  an associated plan view is created in the Project Browser .  
 { 1 } For example ,  if you place walls in the lower level plan ,  
 { 1 } Levels define floor levels of a building or other important datums ,  like the top of a foundation or the roof plate height . 
 { 1 } By contrast ,  when you use the Text Note tool to add a note to the table in the Furniture Plan view ,  
Instead ,  it is added as a view-specific element to enhance the model geometry in the view . 
 { 1 } The text is an annotation element and is visible only in the view in which you place it .   
 { 1 } Additional detail elements ,  which are not modeled in 3D ,  are added to the foundation detail view to further document the model . 
 { 1 } and add a CMU repeating detail component to the wall in the foundation detail view .   
 { 1 } Just like annotation elements ,  detail elements such as lines and detail components are view-specific .  
 { 1 } It also explains the rules that govern their visibility . 
 { 1 } The model elements you add to the project are visible in all views of the project instantly . 
 { 1 } Dimension strings and object tags are also annotation elements ,  so they are view-specific .  
 { 1 } As a final example ,  we will go to the Annotation tab of the ribbon ,  
 { 1 } When you place a table component in the Furniture Plan view ,  it is also visible in the Floor Plan view .   
 { 1 } As you would expect ,  the CMU is not modeled .  
 { 1 } When you add detail elements to model geometry to enhance or clarify the view ,  they are visible only in the view in which you placed them . 
 { 1 } the note does not appear in the Floor Plan view .   
 { 1 } When you place a model family into a project ,  the family displays in all views of the model .  
 { 1 } This video demonstrates how to place a family element in a project and view the properties for the element . 
 { 1 } Create a new family type by duplicating an existing type and making changes to the properties . 
 { 1 } A family contains the graphic information ,  plan ,  elevation ,  section ,  and 3D views ,  used for an element .   
 { 1 } All of the elements in a project are families .   
 { 1 } Usually ,  you can replace a family with a different family by using the Type Selector on the properties palette . 
 { 1 } Instance properties contain information related to that specific instance of the element in the model . 
 { 1 } Use the instance and type properties of families to specify and track information about the elements in your project . 
 { 1 } Revit includes a library of content from which you select families and load them into your project . 
 { 1 } The families also contain non-graphic information in the properties of the element .  
 { 1 } When an element is selected ,  instance properties display on the Properties palette .  
 { 1 } The type properties of a family are applied to all of the elements of the same type in the model .  
 { 1 } Assigning elements to systems also allows you to size duct ,  perform calculations ,  
 { 1 } Notice that the heat pump has more than one system classification .  
 { 1 } This video demonstrates how creating systems in Revit is a key step in automatically generating layouts ,  
 { 1 } You can manually connect equipment and diffusers by placing the duct yourself ,  or you can use the Generate Layout tool to add the duct .  
 { 1 } generate pressure loss reports ,  and use analytical tools in the design . 
 { 1 } Next ,  select the equipment for the system .  
 { 1 } Revit assigns a system name or you can enter a new name . 
 { 1 } You can select a group of diffusers and assign them to the Supply Air system type .  
 { 1 } pressure drop for the system and for using the system inspector . 
 { 1 } sizing duct and pipe ,  and performing calculations and analysis in the design . 
 { 1 } It is assigned to the same system as the diffusers :  Mechanical Supply Air 36 .  
 { 1 } If the default system types do not suit your needs ,  you can also create custom system types .  
 { 1 } In this example ,  a heat pump is added to the system .  
 { 1 } When you create a system ,  you create a logical relationship between related elements in a project .  
 { 1 } From the System Browser ,  select a system type ,  then duplicate and edit it . 
 { 1 } Elements with connectors ,  such as air terminals and equipment ,  are assigned a system classification .  
 { 1 } For example ,  a supply diffuser has a Supply Air system classification .   
 { 1 } The equipment provides the supply for the fluid in the system ,  and is necessary for computing a 
 { 1 } After you have completed adjusting the analytical element ,  click Finish to save changes . 
 { 1 } To work on the analytical model ,  open the Analytical Model view from the Project Browser . 
 { 1 } Click the dialog launcher to open the Structural Settings dialog .  
 { 1 } Select an analytical element to display its direct manipulation controls . 
 { 1 } The Analyze tab contains tools for defining loads and boundary conditions ,  and adjusting the analytical model . 
 { 1 } To see the analytical model in a view ,  click the Show Analytical Model tool on the View control Bar . 
 { 1 } To make further adjustments ,  use the modify tools :  Align ,  Move ,  Pin and Delete . 
 { 1 } To manually adjust the analytical model ,  click Analytical Adjust .  
 { 1 } This view represents the physical model of a building .  
 { 1 } Use the Analytical Model Settings tab to specify auto-detect and consistency check tolerances . 
 { 1 } Use the drop-down list to display physical properties for the selected element . 
 { 1 } When you select an analytical element ,  instance properties display on the properties palette .  
 { 1 } The analytical model is a representation of the building required for structural analysis and design . 
 { 1 } You can reset an analytical element to its original shape or location by clicking Analytical Reset and selecting the element . 
 { 1 } When the cursor displays as an arrow ,  the Modify tool is active ,  and you can select model elements .  
 { 1 } You can also access the Modify tool by pressing Esc or by clicking a blank spot in the drawing area . 
 { 1 } Modify is the default active tool and it is the first tool on every ribbon tab .   
 { 1 } After you select an element ,  a contextual tab displays on the ribbon giving you access to tools that are related to the selected element .   
 { 1 } The Properties palette also displays information about the selected element . 
 { 1 } This video demonstrates how to use the Modify tool to select elements and sets of elements in a model .  
 { 1 } When you place the cursor over an element ,  the element is highlighted .  
 { 1 } Click and drag from left to right to select elements using a containing window . 
 { 1 } allowing you to select all of the elements in the chain at once . 
 { 1 } To activate face selection and other selection options ,  use the drop-down menu on the Modify tool ,  
 { 1 } To add elements to the selection set ,  hold down the Ctrl key while you select elements .  
 { 1 } Whether you select an element at a time or use a window to select a group of elements ,  
 { 1 } or the controls on the right side of the Status Bar .  
 { 1 } Click and drag from right to left to select elements using a crossing window .  
 { 1 } If any chains of connected elements are near the cursor ,  they will be included as candidates ,  
 { 1 } To remove elements from the selection set ,  hold down the Shift key while you select elements . 
 { 1 } Because the “Select elements by face” option is not selected ,  you must place the cursor at the edge of an element to highlight it .   
 { 1 } you can make changes to your selection using the Properties palette and the contextual tools on the ribbon . 
 { 1 } After the element is highlighted ,  click it to select it .  
 { 1 } When you change the position of a wall using the temporary dimensions ,  the roof will respond to the change . 
 { 1 } Similarly ,  because the walls were used to lay out the roof sketch ,  the sketch lines of the roof are constrained to the walls .   
 { 1 } When an element is changed in one view the change is instantly visible in the other views of the model .  
 { 1 } These instant updates are possible  because the model contains both the elements themselves 
 { 1 } This ensures that your model is always up to date for viewing and generating printed documents . 
 { 1 } The model views are always in sync with each other .  
 { 1 } Next ,  set the overhang ,  and use the walls to sketch the boundary of the roof .   
 { 1 } After you have established the boundary ,  you can set the roof slope ,  and finish the roof element . 
 { 1 } Select the walls and attach the tops of the walls to the roof .   
 { 1 } and the logic that manages the relationships between the elements . 
 { 1 } The walls are now constrained to the roof .   
 { 1 } This video demonstrates how the changes you make to elements in one view of a project model are instantly visible in all other views .  
 { 1 } which ensures that the roof you place will be constrained to the roof level in the project . 
 { 1 } When you change the roof geometry or position ,  the walls will respond to the change . 
 { 1 } By selecting this view ,  you make the roof level the active workplane ,  
 { 1 } To see this behavior in action ,  we will place a roof on the model .  
 { 1 } First ,  select the Roof Plan view from the project browser .   
After an element is selected ,  a contextual tab displays on the ribbon giving access to tools related to the selected element .   
To select the highlighted element ,  press the left mouse button . 
When the Modify tool is active ,  you can select elements in your project .   
The Tab key will also allow you to cycle to a chain of connected elements ,  and select all of them at once . 
You can also access the Modify tool by pressing Escape or by clicking a blank spot in the drawing area . 
As the cursor is placed over an element ,  the element is highlighted .  
Selection Narration
The Modify tool is the first tool on every ribbon tab .   
Click the left mouse button and drag to select elements using a crossing window ,  { 1 }  { 2 }  when dragged from right to left ,  or a containing window when dragged from left to right .   
The properties palette also displays specific information about the element . 
The default tool in Revit LT is Modify .   
Notice that the cursor must be at the edge of an element in order for it to be highlighted .   
Click the dimension value to bring it to focus and enter a new dimension .   
The element is moved to the new position . 
You can press the Tab key to cycle to additional selection candidates .   
Witness lines can be changed by clicking and dragging the control  { 1 }  { 2 } on the witness line .   
Click the dimension icon of a temporary dimension to change it to a permanent dimension in the view .  
In this case ,  the Tab key is used to highlight the wall faces rather than the centerline . 
If you select an element in the drawing area ,  temporary dimensions display showing the relationship to other elements .   
The zoom level of the view affects the snap increments of the temporary dimensions .   
Temporary Dimensions Narration
When placing elements ,  temporary dimensions display to establish where an element is located in relation to other elements in the project .   
If you use the keyboard to directly enter a distance value while placing an element ,  the temporary dimension is set to this value . 
The witness line will snap to other positions .   
Families Narration { 1 }  { 2 } 
When a model family is placed into a project ,  the family is displayed in all views of the model . 
Families can be replaced with different families by using the type selector on the properties palette . 
Instance properties display on the properties palette when an element is selected .   
Use the instance and type properties of families to specify and track information about the elements in your project .   
The families also contain non-graphic information in the properties of the element .   
Instance properties contain information related to that specific instance of the element in the model . 
New family types can be created by duplicating an existing type and making change to the properties . 
The type properties of a family are applied to all of the elements of the same type in the model .   
All of the elements in a project are families .   
A family contains the graphic information ,  plan ,  elevation ,  section ,  and 3d views ,  used for an element .   
Clicking on the ViewCube allows you to orient the model to predefined positions .   
The center of rotation is the center point of all of the geometry of the model .   
To open additional views of the model ,  use the project browser .   
In order to see all of the open views at one time in the drawing area ,  you can tile the views .   
Scrolling with the mouse wheel will allow you to zoom in and out of the view . 
In a 3D view ,  hold down the Shift key while pressing the middle button ,  and you will orbit the model . 
You can also click and hold on the ViewCube to drag the model view . 
If an element is selected and then you orbit ,  the center of rotation will be on the selected object . 
You can also tile the views by using the keyboard shortcut  { 1 } WT { 2 }  .    
Locate the view in the project browser ,  and double-click the view name to open it . 
Click the View tab ,  and then click the Tile command .   
When working in Revit LT ,  a common method to navigate within views is to use the middle mouse button .  
When the middle mouse button is pressed ,  you can pan the view .   
Navigation Narration
Use controls in the drawing area to change the elevation of the levels ,  or select a level and make changes on the properties palette . 
In a section or elevation view ,  use the Level tool to place a level .   
Because the walls are constrained to the levels ,  if a level is moved ,  the tops and bottoms of walls constrained to that level are changed as well .    
Top and bottom constraints establish the position of the walls in 3D space . 
By default ,  elements placed in a plan view use the corresponding level datum as a base constraint for the element .   
Levels define floor levels of a building or other important datums ,  such as the top of a foundation ,  or the roof plate height . 
Other datums in the project can be used to define constraints as well .   
By default ,  as a level is placed ,  an associated plan view is created in the project browser .   
For example ,  { 1 }  { 2 }  the walls placed in the lower level plan have their bases constrained to the lower level and their tops constrained to the roof level .   
Use levels to establish a framework for your project .   
When the name of a level is change ,  the corresponding views in the project browser are renamed .   
When walls are placed using the entry level plan ,  their bases are constrained to the entry level . 
Levels Narration
Snaps and guides help you align the extents of the datum with existing levels in the project .   
The visibility and graphics settings of a view control how categories of elements are displayed .   
The graphics of a category or element can also be changed by using the visibility overrides .   
A category’s or element’s visibility can also be turned off by selecting the element in the view .  
With nothing selected in the view ,  click Visibility and Graphics in the properties palette ,  or type the keyboard shortcut  { 1 } VG { 2 }  to display the Visibility and Graphics dialog . 
Use the Reveal Hidden Elements tool to quickly see which elements and categories are hidden in the view . 
Select an element and right-click .  
Clear the checkmark for a category to turn off its visibility in the view . 
If you are using imported CAD files ,  the visibility of the layers of the CAD file are controlled here .   
In the dialog ,  the tabs group the categories into model categories ,  annotation categories ,  and imported categories .   
Visibility/Graphics Narration
 { 1 }  { 2 } Then right-click ,  and select the Hide in View command to turn off the element or category visibility . 
Select Override Graphics in View to open the Override dialog and make changes to the appearance of the element . 
Sketching is used to define many objects such as sweeps ,  openings ,  and regions . 
Use the tools on the Draw panel to create a closed-loop sketch of the object’s boundaries .   
When you select a tool that requires you to sketch a boundary ,  such as the Floor tool ,  sketch mode is automatically enabled .   
These objects require a sketch to define the edges of the element .   
After you have completed the closed-loop sketch you must click Finish to complete the element . 
Sketching Narration
In sketch mode ,  the other elements in the drawing area are lightened and the Draw panel is displayed in the ribbon .   
Make changes to the sketch using the draw tools ,  or use the modify tools to edit the existing sketch lines . 
Sketching is a concept essential to the creation of many types of objects .   
To make changes to the boundary sketch of an existing element ,  select the element and click Edit Boundary on the contextual tab .

To address both areas which can affect model performance ,  the Autodesk® Revit® team has assembled this collection of hardware requirements ,  recommendations and modeling best practices as researched by both internal development and our community of dedicated customers . 
Please refer to the document below for comprehensive recommendations on the Mac platform : 
Revit { 1 } ® { 2 }  for { 3 }  Citrix { 4 }  { 5 } ® { 6 }  { 7 } 
http : //images . autodesk . com/adsk/files/autodesk_revit_architecture__mep__structure_mac_faq_final . pdf
Just as no two buildings are identical ,  no two models of differing buildings are precisely identical in the tactics and strategies that will yield the most robust performance ,  but the recommendations that follow are designed as a set of tools to be selected singly or in combination to help produce in a timely fashion models that are consistent ,  computable ,  and communicative of design intent . 
As always ,  our thanks go to our customers ,  who are part of the team helping to improve Revit { 1 } ®  { 2 } with every release through their insightful comments and suggestions .

Like any design instrument ,  Autodesk® Revit® performance can depend as much on the knowledge ,  skill and practices of its users as on the hardware environment provided for the software .  
Many people on the Autodesk { 1 } ® { 2 }  Revit { 3 } ®  { 4 } team from Support ,  Quality Assurance ,  Development ,  Consulting and Product Management contributed to this document ,  but a number of recommendations arose from the community of Autodesk { 5 } ® { 6 }  Revit { 7 } ®  { 8 } users ,  who generously contributed their time and expertise to their peers in a number of forums ,  and urged Autodesk { 9 } ®    { 10 } to help share their knowledge with an even wider audience .

This approach will prevent Windows from changing the size of the swap file while you are working .  
Additional multi-threaded capabilities are added with every release . 
Because of their substantial performance benefits ,  Autodesk strongly recommends CPUs which include an L2 cache .  
 { 1 } The amount of local machine RAM required is approximately 20 times the size of your compacted central project file .

Revit maintains model data in memory and hard disk caches to increase performance against repeated data access ,  but as a consequence of extended model manipulation Revit performance may benefit from an application restart ,  especially before triggering the following memory-intensive tasks : 
Loading elements into memory .  
 { 1 }  { 2 }  { 3 } Autodesk strongly recommends dedicated video cards supporting  { 4 } DirectX 11 or later . 
Some reports show as much as a 20% increase in Revit performance in a multi-core or multiple processor environment .

 { 1 } The Revit team strongly recommends a 64-bit operating system .  { 2 } 
Autodesk Revit is a computationally intensive application ,  and will benefit from a high-performance CPU .  
 { 1 }  { 2 } Consider video cards designed to support CAD applications . 
Translation of high level graphical representation of model elements and annotations into display lists optimized for given graphics card .  
 { 1 }  { 2 } Close and restart Revit . 
To adjust paging file size follow these steps : 
 { 1 }  { 2 } Centrino/Pentium-M/Core Intel processors for laptops work well with Revit ,  and are recommended for laptops given their higher efficiency and reduced heat output .  
Larger ,  more complex models will make use of more RAM .  
 { 1 }  { 2 } Go to main “R” menu { 3 }  { 4 } 
If higher performance is desired during these operations ,  a faster hard drive may provide some benefit ,  however the Revit team considers this workstation improvement of lower priority when compared with performance enhancements related to CPU speed and increasing available RAM . 
 { 1 }  { 2 } Although the Revit platform is not fully optimized for multi-threading ,  multiple-core processors reduce cycle use by other applications running concurrently .  
 { 1 } Minimum RAM is 4 GB but 16GB is recommended .  
Click the Visual Effects Tab . 
See “Windows Operating Systems” below for configuration notes .  { 1 } 
For the Windows swap file ,  it is recommended that you set both the minimum and maximum settings to the same value ,  which should be at least twice the value of your installed RAM .

 { 1 }  { 2 } Integrated video support should be avoided because these cards make use of machine RAM rather than on-card memory . 
Clear the Show window content while dragging option . 
 { 1 } 64-bit operating systems place no practical limit to the quantity of memory available to applications .  
Reduces view open times when elements are displayed for the first time in a session . 
See “Windows Operating Systems” below .  { 1 } 
 { 1 }  { 2 } Check the “Use Hardware Acceleration” box ,  illustrated below . 
It is recommended that you defragment local PCs and servers periodically .  
 { 1 } Under Performance ,  click Settings . 
 { 1 } Remove unneeded area schemes . 
Delete unused groups from the project browser . 
 { 1 } Utilize rebar sets instead of individual rebar elements where possible .  { 2 } 
 { 1 } Parametric families place a greater computational burden on the model than static families .  
 { 1 } Limit the creation of parts and assemblies necessary elements to avoid overloading your model with unneeded detail . 
 { 1 } Regularly review and fix warnings .  { 2 } 
 { 1 } Gigabit speed Ethernet cards at the desktop .  { 2 } 
Servers storing Revit central files can benefit from : 
 { 1 } Because families are optimized for repetition ,  create a family component instead of in-place families when components are going to be repeated .  
 { 1 }  { 2 }  { 3 } Constraints { 4 }  { 5 }  { 6 }  { 7 } 
 { 1 } Avoid exploding the geometry imported from DWG files .  
 { 1 } Individual towers { 2 } 
 { 1 } Regularly purge unused objects .  
 { 1 } Families are “lighter” than groups .   
 { 1 } Hard drive speeds as fast as economically practical { 2 } 
 { 1 } If you have two levels with the same elevation ,  Revit will perform better if all rooms are placed on one of the two levels ,  rather than dividing the same rooms between the two levels .  { 2 } 
Use families instead of groups ,  where possible .    
 { 1 } Limit joined geometry to necessities .  { 2 } 
 { 1 } Minimize geometric detail that will be invisible at the chosen output scale .  
Unless material use or other types of analysis will be applied to the model ,  consider that a generic wall may be sufficient for some projects or project areas .  { 1 } 
 { 1 } Unload links of all types if not used .  
Click Architecture tab in the ribbon ,  then expand Room and Area tools ,  and select Area and Volume Computations 
 { 1 } Preserve design options only as long as they are useful to the project .  
MS Paint refers to this format as Monochrome Bitmap .  { 1 } 
When volume computation is off ,  Revit will represent rooms as simple extrusions ,  without considering ceilings ,  roofs ,  floors ,  or other upper or lower boundaries .  
 { 1 }  { 2 }  { 3 } Remove unneeded raster images and renderings .  
 { 1 } Promptly resolve warnings about room boundaries overlapping .  { 2 } 
 { 1 } Avoid coincident room separation lines overlapping each other and overlapping walls .  
Minimal constraints will help prevent : 
 { 1 } If a lengthy railing element is desired ,  consider modeling a simplified railing representation ,  relying on railing details to fully describe the design .  { 2 } 
 { 1 } Avoid use of railings for extensive fences or separation systems and limit the visibility of such elements .  
A total of 8GB of memory is recommended for such systems to make available 4GB of memory to Revit ,  at least 1GB for the OS ,  and additional memory for other commonly used applications to run comfortably alongside Revit .  { 1 } 
 { 1 } Interiors { 2 } 
 { 1 } Consistent customer practice is break up a large model into multiple files of about 200 MB for 64-bit Revit ,  and 160 MB for 32-bit ,  and link together the resulting project files . 
Consider modeling building components such as HVAC registers as 2D ceiling- or face-based families to reduce penetration calculations .  { 1 } 
To locate room separation lines in a model ,  create a wireframe view template with walls and room or space separation lines visible . 
Groups are very powerful ,  but updating large quantities of group instances consumes significant computing resources .  { 1 } 
Because volume computations may affect the performance of your Revit project ,  they are disabled by default ,  except Revit MEP where the setting is enabled .  
When serving a geographically diverse project team across a wide area network  ( WAN )  the Revit team strongly recommends traffic acceleration .  
 { 1 } Show more accurate room color fills in section views { 2 } 
The necessary level of detail in a given model can often be conveyed to a team in terms of a commonly understood drawing scale ,  such “Provide detail to a ¼” level of detail” or some other commonly employed measure of scale .  
Save black and white raster images as 1 bit per pixel format instead of JPG or TIF .  
 { 1 } A 64-bit OS should not be expected to provide increased performance ;  however ,  customers have reported increased stability due to the capability of Revit to access additional memory .  { 2 } 
Since purged objects cannot be recovered ,  you may wish to make a backup of the project before purging .  { 1 } 
This should limit memory resources necessary to open the file . 
 { 1 } Minimize the number of linked or imported DWG files .  { 2 } 
http : //wikihelp . autodesk . com/Revit/enu/2014/Help/3663-BIM_Mana3663/3691-Revit_Se3691
The Revit team strongly recommends a gigabit speed local area network  ( LAN )  for workshared projects .  
Temporarily unload links if not needed in the view and reload them as required .  
 { 1 } Importing & Linking { 2 }  { 3 } 
 { 1 } Use symbolic lines and masking regions instead of geometry in plan views to show simple geometric representations .  
 { 1 } Limit the use of rooms in design options as additional time is spent on detecting room option conflict . 
The exploding operation within Revit can change a DWG from a single managed element to hundreds or thousands of additional elements depending on the number of entities in the imported DWG .  
 { 1 } Avoid importing unnecessary data like hatching or AutoCAD-specific linework such as construction lines .  
 { 1 } Multiple processors { 2 } 
 { 1 } Gigabit switches .  { 2 } 
The 3D toilet below is completely modeled : 
After the array is deployed ,  performance may be improved by ungrouping the arrayed ,  removing the parametric associations of the copied objects .   
 { 1 } Where possible ,  avoid arrays and formulas .  { 2 } 
Engineering consumers of architectural models may have to maintain one or more constantly loaded links ,  which may affect model size estimation and thresholds for those disciplines .  { 1 } 
 { 1 } When creating detail views ,  model hatches with filled regions not lines .  { 2 } 
Revit will need to process these additional boundaries ,  which can affect model performance .  
Upgrade links before upgrading the host file ,  or if necessary ,  unload all RVT links before upgrading the host file .  { 1 } 
Increasing numbers of elements will affect regeneration ,  manipulation and view update time .  { 1 } 
 { 1 } Families which cut their hosts consume significant computing resources on regeneration when compared to families that reside on a given surface without cutting the host .  
The following illustrations show two families ,  both designed to represent the same toilet in plan :  { 1 } 
 { 1 } Parts and Assemblies { 2 } 
 { 1 } Monochrome raster images are smaller than color images .  
 { 1 } Revit to compute the volume numbers for each room prior to printing scheduled room volumes .  { 2 } 
As provided by several appliances currently on the market
 { 1 } To change the room volume calculation settings ,  follow these steps :  { 2 } 
This allows Revit to avoid processing complex geometry when it is not necessary .  { 1 } 
Consider creating a smaller ,  simplified image for import into Revit . 
 { 1 } Limit the use of detailed/nested/parameterized families to necessities .  { 2 } 
There are only views available of the toilet in elevation and plan ,  which is sufficient for most project needs .  
The Revit Server network architecture is designed to support worksharing of multiple central models across a wide area network  ( WAN )  and maximize performance of Revit worksharing for distributed teams . 
Consider carefully whether a family needs parametric flexibility and confine that flexibility to necessary adjustments .  { 1 } 
The following sections will examine many aspects of modeling and recommend certain practices in particular situations ,  but examining a model and its constituent families with these factors in mind will aid in optimizing model performance . 
 { 1 } Switch off visibility of 2D AutoCAD DWGs in perpendicular views .   
Even though options may not be active and visible ,  when changes are made within the main model all design options will update .  { 1 } 
Favor a minimal rather than a comprehensive template . 
Some typical cleavage points to divide a single project into multiple models include :  { 1 } 
 { 1 } Turning volume computation off can improve performance ,  but will disable much of the volume analytical functionality in Revit MEP .  
Unlink files that are no longer necessary .  { 1 } 
 { 1 } Avoid maintaining unnecessary groups .  
 { 1 }  { 2 }  { 3 } DWG Files { 4 }  { 5 }  { 6 }  { 7 } 
 { 1 } Consider creating parts in a separate model and linking in the original .  { 2 } 
As much as possible ,  leverage the project team’s understanding of typical 2D drawing conventions to invest the correct level of complexity into the model .  { 1 } 
 { 1 }  { 2 } Remote Desktop Sharing { 3 } 
 { 1 }  { 2 }  { 3 }  { 4 }  { 5 } Network Recommendations { 6 }  { 7 }  { 8 }  { 9 } 
The Windows OS will always reserve at least 1GB of memory for OS services and hardware management .

 { 1 } Parking structure ( s )  { 2 }  { 3 } 
 { 1 } One or more gigabit Ethernet cards at the data storage device  ( server or Storage Area Network )  housing the central model { 2 } 
 { 1 } Large raster images such as logos scaled down to fit into title blocks will still retain the original file size .  
 { 1 } Avoid populating project templates with an excessive number of families that may or may not be useful for every project .  
 { 1 } Large projects may benefit from breaking a model into separate project files and linking them into a single central file and assigning each model to a workset  ( see Worksets section )  .  
 { 1 } Use separate models for variations of the whole building wings .  { 2 } 
 { 1 } Arrays { 2 }  { 3 }  { 4 }  { 5 } 
The 2D version of this family is 20% smaller than the 3D version .  
 { 1 } Graphically complex views { 2 } 
This option is a type parameter of the linked file .  { 1 } 
 { 1 } Like railings ,  stairs are complex elements ,  but may not be easily simplified .  
32-bit Revit will access up to 4GB of RAM in a 64-Bit OS environment if at least 5GB is available .  
Carefully consider what to model .  
 { 1 } Host files containing RVT file links will consume more memory on version upgrade than files lacking RVT links .  
Turn volume computations on when you need to :  { 1 } 
 { 1 } Place room separation lines on one workset for better control .  
 ( see Worksets section )  .  { 1 } 
 { 1 } If the link is located on the network ,  importing rather than linking may improve performance .  { 2 } 
The  { 1 } Group And Associate  { 2 } checkbox may also be cleared before when creating the array to attain the same result . 
 { 1 }  { 2 }  { 3 } General Guidelines { 4 } 
 { 1 } Workset sharing issues where a user may unknowingly take ownership of an object .  { 2 } 
 { 1 } To export a gbXML file .  { 2 } 
The gigabit threshold should be served at all stages of the network ,  including : 
Multiplied over an entire project ,  a larger family can add significantly to a model’s size and computational burden . 
 { 1 } Where possible ,  avoid widespread use of voids in family geometry .  { 2 } 
Delete unnecessary parts and layers of the DWG file within AutoCAD and import only the cleaned ,  smaller DWG .  { 1 } 
Performance gains may be found as much in the construction of individual families as in other modeling practices . 
When an in-place family is copied  ( which it may already be problematic )  ,  it makes an entirely new entity each time ,  as opposed to referencing the information from the first instance .  { 1 } 
A 2D AutoCAD file linked into a plan view will show as collinear lines in elevation ,  leading to performance degradation . 
Raster images represent a performance and file size cost which should be minimized .  { 1 } 
 { 1 } Data Server Specification { 2 } 
 { 1 } Expansion joints { 2 } 
For more information on Revit Server see : 
 { 1 } Family Creation { 2 } 
Objects only viewed from certain points need only be modeled to appear correct in those selected views .  
 { 1 } Only link essential DWG files into necessary views .   
There is no warning offered by Revit ,  but performance is impacted because of the number of lines required to generate each railing element .  { 1 } 
 { 1 } Consider whether options should be preserved long term in separate models which can be linked as needed . 
 { 1 } Account for the location of elements in volumes based upon the bounded volume geometry .  { 2 } 
 { 1 }  { 2 }  { 3 } Revit Model Optimization { 4 }  and Best Practices { 5 }  { 6 }  { 7 } 
 { 1 } Until wall ,  roof ,  window and door type construction are determined ,  use the generic versions of these elements which incorporate less geometry .  
 { 1 } Only select the Room Bounding option for linked files if they are absolutely needed to bound volumes  ( rooms and spaces )  .  
 { 1 } “Can’t keep joined” errors to a minimum when moving objects . 
Confine stair visibility to essential views .  { 1 } 
 { 1 } Set room or space separation line color to red with a heavy line weight so they are easy to identify . 
 { 1 } Modeling Economically { 2 }  { 3 } 
  This procedure will work best if the user can work on one file while the other links are unloaded for a majority of the time .  
 { 1 } Put links and imports into individual worksets and close the worksets when not in use .  { 2 } 
 { 1 } When a project has been edited by other users for a day or more ,  it may be faster to create a new local from the central model rather than relying on “Reload latest” to update the individual local model a day or more behind the remainder of the team .  { 2 } 
 { 1 } Any large project requires constant team coordination .  
 { 1 } Grids and levels { 2 } 
 { 1 } Turn off unnecessary categories in Visibility/Graphics and templates .  { 2 } 
 { 1 } Minimize view quantity to help reduce model size .  
 { 1 } To reduce disk usage ,  regularly compact central and local files .  { 2 } 
Cancelling “Synch with Central” will prevent queuing the save request ,  allowing the user to continue to edit the local file before another “Synch with Central” command .  { 1 } 
A dramatically weaker machine specification used by a single team member can reduce overall project performance .  { 1 } 
 { 1 } “Synch with Central” operations can be accelerated by a preceding “Reload Latest” command .  { 2 } 
 { 1 } When attempts to “Synch with Central” collide ,  Revit displays a dialog notifying that another user is currently saving to central .  
 { 1 } Minimize view depth where possible in elevation ,  plan ,  and section views so that geometry hidden by other elements in the view does not affect the view drawing performance .  { 2 } 
Alternatively ,  team members could stagger their regular saves to central by either communicating an intention to save to central to the team or by assigning a standard saving time to each team member ,  i . e .  ,  at ten or fifteen minutes after the hour .  { 1 } 
Selecting “Close Hidden Windows” will close the concealed views ,  allowing Revit to update only the current view with changes until other views are reopened :  { 1 } 
When repeating such an operation several times ,  performance will be improved by opening all the target views before beginning the sequence of paste operations .  { 1 } 
 { 1 } Because Revit attempts to update all open views before saving ,  both local saves and saving to central will increase in performance if a simple view ,  such as a drafting view ,  is the only view open when the save operation begins .  { 2 } 
To optimize static models to be linked into active models  ( for instance ,  in the case of an existing contextual building model adjoined to a model of new construction )  delete as many views as possible from the static model to be linked .  { 1 } 
 { 1 } Close unnecessary windows .  
 { 1 } Avoid hiding large quantities of individual elements in views . 
Revit originally implemented worksets as a mechanism to enable multiple users to collaborate on a single model by taking temporary ownership of user-defined element groups .  
 { 1 } Close worksets not required for a given editing session . 
 { 1 } Use “Wireframe” or “Shading” display modes when working in linked file environment . 
In the following illustration ,  although the current view appears relatively simple ,  the Window menu shows there are a number of other views open .  
This level of control can represent an advantage over view dependent features such as View Filters or Visibility / Graphics in certain workflows .  { 1 } 
 { 1 } When making significant changes in a project  ( moving a level or major geometry changes )  ,  it is recommended that you perform the operation when no other users are working on the file and they have relinquished all elements ,  then have all users make new local files .  { 2 } 
In that event ,  BIM managers or team leaders will sometimes choose check out the workset ( s )  containing these elements so that they cannot be casually edited or relocated .  { 1 } 
Often the overhead associated with additional object cutting due to back clipping is more than offset by the resulting reduced geometry maintenance .  { 1 } 
Favor a “Coarse” view setting unless required to show greater detail :  { 1 } 
 { 1 }  { 2 }  { 3 }  { 4 } Revit Structure Optimization { 5 }  and Best Practices { 6 }  { 7 }  { 8 }   { 9 }  { 10 } 
 { 1 } Linked RVT and DWG files { 2 } 
 { 1 } Revit saves only one local model at a time to the central file .  
 { 1 } Room separation lines  ( see Rooms and Spaces section )  { 2 } 
When working in a 3D view ,  most of the file is placed into RAM .  
In a 1/8” plan view ,  assigning a “fine” level of display detail may be unnecessary .  
 { 1 } Spatially identifiable areas of a single building  ( wings ,  for example )  { 2 } 
As deadlines approach and the frequency of saving to central increases ,  us the “Worksharing Monitor” feature to coordinate “Save to Central” commands across the team .  
 { 1 } Attempt to keep project team workstation specifications equivalent .  
 { 1 } Worksets can help manage element visibility to reduce visual clutter during editing ,  as well as Revit’s use of memory .  
Plan views with fine and medium detail level are slow to open if there are many wall join layers to route .   
Most customers have realized many benefits by providing teams with instant messaging  ( IM )  software to help coordinate model editing and saving between geographically dispersed teams .  { 1 } 
Closing currently unneeded worksets can release allocated RAM for Revit’s use in memory-intensive tasks such as printing ,  exporting and upgrading existing models to the current Revit version .  { 1 } 
 { 1 } Consider back clipping views to reduce the quantity of geometry maintained in a view .  
The Revit platform team recommends that worksets should be employed most often to segregate conceptual areas of a project ,  such as :  { 1 } 
 { 1 } Separate buildings { 2 } 
  { 1 } “Paste aligned” into closed views will open and close the target views .  
 { 1 } Use selective workset opening on when opening a workshared project file .  { 2 } 
Using element borrowing ,  users select the elements to edit ,  allowing Revit to silently grant and manage ownership of the elements until the user’s next “Synch with Central” makes the edited elements available to all other users of the model .  { 1 } 
 { 1 } Today ,  Revit has transparent element borrowing ,  which automatically assigns ownership of an edited element to a user ,  allowing more intuitive interaction with the model in a multi-user environment .  
 { 1 } Worksets remain extremely valuable for data segregation ,  optimum workflow ,  and good data management ,  since they enable selectively opening and closing portions of a project across all project views .  
It is also recommended that these views should be closed when saving to central ,  since Revit will update this complex  view as part of the save process .  { 1 } 
 { 1 } Building shell { 2 } 
 { 1 } Zoom in to speed up drawing and snapping .  { 2 } 
Often ,  users will not realize that half a dozen or more views are currently open .  
 { 1 } Furniture and equipment spanning multiple categories { 2 } 
 { 1 } Building core { 2 } 
 { 1 } Use section boxes to limit visible geometry when working in a 3D view .  { 2 } 
 { 1 } Analytical Model Management { 2 }  { 3 }  { 4 }  { 5 } 
“Checking out” a workset prevented other users from editing any part of that workset until control was relinquished on a “Save to Central” operation . 
 { 1 } While the capability to check out a workset remains valuable under certain circumstances outlined below ,  in general the best practice is to use element borrowing rather than checking out entire worksets .  
 { 1 } Turn off shadows in views where they are unnecessary .  { 2 } 
In the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog for the view  ( click View tab  { 1 } ➤ { 2 }  Graphics panel  { 3 } ➤ { 4 }  Visibility/Graphics )  ,  set the detail level of the appropriate components to the simplest level acceptable . 
When contacting Autodesk technical support services concerning performance issues ,  please provide the following information and materials : 
Ensure that the Flow Direction parameter for connectors on families in the connected network is not set to Bidirectional unless the family is placed in-line with connected networks like dampers and valves .  
The rate of decrease is directly related to the topics mentioned in this section . 
■ Differentiate modeling views from sheet views both in the view name and sub-discipline to provide a logical organization of the view for users ,  and help to ensure proper usage . 
A description of the issue ,  including : 
If possible ,  avoid excessive modeling of the 3D connections ,  such as connection plates ,  bolts ,  etc )  in Revit Structure .  
Connection Elements
Understanding these factors ,  and adhering to the best practices outlined below ,  will allow for optimal model performance . 
This strategy creates separate project files for different regions of the building ,  keeping all disciplines in each file . 
See the following link for the procedure to obtain the journal file :   { 1 } http : //usa . autodesk . com/getdoc/id=TS1067426 { 2 }  
Testing of customer models with all elements on the default system showed significant improvements when the connected network was restructured as logical systems . 
■ Use view templates to streamline the creation of these views and achieve consistency . 
Simplify the Display of Architectural Elements
Improper structure and configuration of large connected networks has been shown to have a severe impact on model manipulation performance .  
In order to achieve optimal coordination between the MEP disciplines ,  each discipline must be within the same Revit project file .  
To disable the feature ,  go to “R” -> Options -> User Interface ,  and uncheck “Structural analysis and tools”
Use the following best practices to optimize the performance of views with the Hidden Line model graphics style enabled . 
Once the computation is done ,  such delay should no longer occur . 
Although elements display as 2D lines in a Revit view ,  in the model they are 3D objects made up of faces .  
■ Avoid using the Fine detail level when working in mechanical views unless necessary ,  as multi-line representations slow performance .  
Create Systems
This may be done by overriding the Detail Level setting in the view . 
Revit MEP allows users to create models of building services ,  often in the form of large connected networks .  
Accompanying materials : 
Because the performance of connected networks decreases with larger size ,  the benefits of data propagation and connectivity may be outweighed by the need for better model manipulation performance . 
There are two fundamental ways to structure the MEP project files :  by MEP discipline or by region of the building .  
For example ,  the Coarse detail level may be applied to walls even when the view is configured to use Medium or Fine  ( refer to figures below )  .  
These settings may be configured in view templates and applied to your views to quickly simplify the detail level throughout your project . 
■ The Autodesk design files involved in the project :  Local file ,  Central file and any linked RVT ,  DWG and DWF files
 { 1 }  { 2 }  { 3 }  { 4 } Revit MEP Optimization { 5 }  and Best Practices { 6 }  { 7 }  { 8 }  
Note :   After re-enabling the Structural analysis and tools on an existing project ,  when opening the model or adding a new structural element again into the model ,  you may experience a very long delay and waiting time because Revit has to recompute all the Analytical Check information .  
While maintaining the entire design for a building service in one well connected model allows for full data propagation ,  the size of the connected network is directly related to its manipulation performance .  
Make those model lines visible at the detail level defined in your sheet views . 
Due to the requirement to dynamically generate gaps and hidden lines when elements overlap in the view ,  the Hidden Line style requires the most processing and thus results in a noticeable performance impact in views with many visible elements .  
■ If a network problem or operating system problem is suspected ,  obtain a System Information  ( NFO )  file .  
The following best practices will help to mitigate this performance impact and streamline project workflows . 
Follow these guidelines : 
Associating elements into systems helps to streamline data propagation and facilitates the analytical uses of systems ,  such as in pressure drop calculations .

Interacting with Autodesk Support
■ Sheet views should be configured to use the Hidden Line model graphics style to produce the desired appearance for construction documentation . 
■ If using complex 3D components in your building service designs ,  turn off the visibility of the complex 3D geometry in your sheet views .  
Note :   To Disable the Analytical Support Check feature for a Worksharing project ,  please make sure to modify the User Interface setting in ALL user local computers that are working on this project . 
■ For your sheet views ,  use dependent views ,  which allows you to have multiple regions of an overall level in different views ,  without requiring duplicate annotations . 
The faces are processed by the Revit graphics system and display in the view as 2D lines .  
■ Use duct and pipe color fills only in modeling views where the Wireframe model graphics style is used . 
Set Correct Connector Flow Directions
■ Recent changes ,  if any ,  to the hardware and software of the affected machine
Multiple Files
■ The Revit-based application journal file from the affected computer .  
Based on these considerations ,  it may be helpful to structure large projects by region of the building . 
In comparative testing ,  models have been shown to perform significantly better when structured properly . 
The Model Graphics Style settings have the largest impact on performance for view manipulation operations  ( scroll ,  pan ,  and zoom )  .  
■ A summary of any attempts to resolve the issue before contacting support
As a connected network grows ,  the performance of model manipulations  ( such as moving elements ,  changing flows ,  and connecting new elements )  is impacted by a number of factors .  
■ Whether the problem has occurred before
Modeling and Sheet Views
■ When the problem began to occur  ( if no date is available ,  an approximate date is better than none ) 
Both of these approaches have their benefits and drawbacks ,  and ultimately it is the choice of the BIM/CAD manager . 
In place of the complex 3D geometry ,  use model lines that convey the overall component shape in the family definition .  
In these cases ,  the model should be built across multiple Revit project files . 
Create logical systems for your connected networks ,  rather than leaving all elements on the default system .  
By Region
This organization allows disciplines to connect to each other's elements directly ,  like electrical connections or drain connections on mechanical equipment .  
The Bidirectional setting can make flow determination more difficult and thus impact regeneration performance . 
The powerful analytical capabilities of Revit MEP ,  in conjunction with the Revit Parametric Change Engine ,  allow data to flow throughout the connected network when manipulations are made . 
■ Modeling views should be configured to use the Wireframe model graphics style . 
Simplifying the display of architectural elements may help improve performance by reducing the visible elements that must be generated and maintained within the view .  
When doing typical detail ,  create or use 2D detail component connections instead .  
Model Manipulation Performance
■ If not necessary for documentation when working with hidden lines in a view ,  setting the Mech Hidden value for Inside Gap and Outside Gap to 0 can provide substantial performance improvements . 
Displaying pipes as 1-line at Medium detail level is usually sufficient when working with HVAC systems . 
For large ,  complex buildings ,  the aforementioned best practices may still not provide optimum model manipulation performance .  
Testing has shown a linear decrease in manipulation performance as a connected network size grows .  
View Performance
Performance in views with the Hidden Line model graphics style enabled is directly related to the number of faces displayed in the view .  
Optimizing Hidden Line Performance
To streamline project workflow ,  it is recommended to create both modeling and sheet views for the same regions of the building . 
Additionally ,  product team testing has shown that separate connected networks do not have a significant impact on each other ;  a duct network does not have a significant impact on model manipulation of a plumbing network in the same project file . 
This strategy creates separate project files for each MEP discipline ;  that is ,  separate Mechanical ,  Electrical ,  Plumbing ,  and Fire Protection files .

What about licensing?
Hardware configuration changes can cause licensing issues when you use Revit Architecture ,  Revit MEP ,  and Revit Structure ,  and Revit LT in both Boot Camp and Parallels on the same machine .  
Autodesk has not tested and does not support using Revit-based products with other virtualization software . 
After installation ,  use Boot Camp to operate your Mac using a dual boot system .  
Once you start the computer ,  the selected OS runs in native mode .  
If you are using a 64-bit Windows OS ,  512-MB is the recommended setting .  { 1 } 
There are advantages and disadvantages to each .  
Because a notebook is configured to preserve battery life ,  the Power Options may need to be adjusted to take full advantage of processor speed .  
Supports partition sizes greater than 32 GB
Using the system as the network license server is not supported . 
Use the utility to run applications in the required operating system without restarting .  
However ,  a system with both a dual boot and virtual machine configuration provides the greatest flexibility to the user .  
For example ,  a 2 . 8 GHz processor may be operating at 1 . 59 GHz to conserve power using the default Portable/Laptop setting . 
If you start the computer in Windows ,  you can install and run Windows applications at native speeds . 
You can usually recover from the first license error using this method .   { 1 } 
Ability to read/write Windows files from the Mac OS
You can use either a standalone or network license of Revit Architecture ,  Revit MEP ,  and Revit Structure ,  and Revit LT .  
You can then run applications in each operating system without restarting the computer .

Clicking "More information" on error dialogs does not open the correct page .  
Autodesk Inventor Fusion is a useful tool for preparing CAD geometry for simulation .  
When applying fluid reaction forces from Simulation CFD to a Simulation Mechanical nonlinear analysis ,  the fluid reaction forces can only be controlled by Load Curve 1 . 
Once this is done ,  an orange sphere appears on the model .  
For more about Simulation CFD 2015 ,  please see the Simulation CFD  { 1 } /view/SCDSE/2015/ENU/?guid=GUID-6949D0A0-0F90-456E-89E5-7E2B6841983A { 2 } Readme .  { 3 } 
Boundary conditions are hidden from view ,  including injection cones ,  coolant inlets ,  constraints . 
When using the "Select Surface" option to apply a spatially varying boundary condition ,  the feedback arrow does not appear on the model .  
The following plots from Moldflow Adviser are not displayed :  Pressure at end of fill ,  Temperature at end of fill ,  and Average volumetric shrinkage . 
To fix this ,  open the "SimCFDHelpIds . xml" file located in the Program Files\Autodesk\Simulation CFD 2015 folder ,  and change the value of  { 1 } online_search { 2 }  from  { 3 } /?=  { 4 } to { 5 }  ?query= { 6 }  . 
Be sure to use valid characters for the file name when saving to Autodesk 360 .  
However ,  you can pull these Rhino models into Simulation Mechanical using the Open dialog box . 
If you login through the Simulation Job Manger and disconnect from the Internet ,  local solving will not be available .

This process will need to be repeated each time you want to work with the drawing in a prior version of the application after editing the subassembly properties in AutoCAD Civil 3D 2015 . 
If you do not have backups of the C : \ProgramData\Autodesk\C3D <version>\enu\Imported Tools\<PKT name> folders that you can use when you want to work with the drawing in a prior version of the application ,  you can use the following process to restore the subassembly : 
Working With Drawings in  { 1 } AutoCAD Civil 3D { 2 } 2015 { 3 }  and in Prior Versions of  { 4 } AutoCAD Civil 3D { 5 } 
If you edit the projection style in a prior version of AutoCAD Civil 3D to display AutoCAD solids as markers and then reopen the drawing in AutoCAD Civil 3D 2015 ,  the projected solids are displayed as markers and the projection style is set to display the solids as markers . 
If you edit the alignment or the projected solids in a prior version of AutoCAD Civil 3D and save the drawing ,  the profile views are updated when the drawing is reopened in AutoCAD Civil 3D 2015 .  
The new  { 1 } Section { 2 }  setting available on the  { 3 } Profile { 4 }  tab of the  { 5 } Projection Style { 6 }  dialog box will not be retained if the drawing is opened in a prior version of AutoCAD Civil 3D . 
The new assembly frequency settings available in the  { 1 } Frequency To Apply Assemblies { 2 }  dialog box will not be retained if the drawing is opened in a prior version of AutoCAD Civil 3D .  
round-tripping data
This occurs because some modifications are made to the custom subassembly files when the subassembly properties are modified in AutoCAD Civil 3D 2015 . 
This topic describes the behavior of certain features when a drawing is worked with in  { 1 } AutoCAD Civil 3D { 2 } 2015 { 3 }  and in prior versions of  { 4 } AutoCAD Civil 3D { 5 }  . 
These curves must be converted to use a different constraint type such as length or K value if you intend to use the drawing in prior versions .  
Horizontal change notification symbols are saved in the drawing but will not be displayed if the drawing is opened in a prior version of AutoCAD Civil 3D . 
After editing the subassembly properties in AutoCAD Civil 3D 2015 ,  and before re-opening the drawing in the prior version of the application ,  use the backups to overwrite the contents of the C : \ProgramData\Autodesk\C3D <version>\enu\Imported Tools\<PKT name> folders .  
Re-import the subassembly into the Tool Palette . 
When the corridor is rebuilt in a prior version ,  stations will no longer be applied adjacent to the start and end of offset targets ,  along offset target curves ,  or along baseline curves  ( using the  { 1 } By Curvature { 2 }  setting )  . 
Subassembly PKT Files
These backups can be used if you want to work with the drawing in a prior version of the application . 
Open the drawing in the prior version of the application . 
Delete the subassembly from the Tool Palette . 
Horizontal Change Notification Symbols for Profiles
Free vertical curves that are created with the new  { 1 } Free Vertical Curve  ( Circular )  { 2 }  and  { 3 } Free Vertical Curve  ( Parabolic )  { 4 }  commands and which use a pass-through point as their constraint type will not be displayed if the drawing is opened in a prior version of AutoCAD Civil 3D .  
Close the application and restart it . 
Re-insert the subassembly into the drawing . 
AutoCAD Solids Projected to Profiles
Therefore ,  before using AutoCAD Civil 3D 2015 to work with existing drawings that contain custom subassemblies ,  it is strongly recommended that you create a backup of the C : \ProgramData\Autodesk\C3D <version>\enu\Imported Tools\<PKT name> folders .  
Assembly Frequency Settings
Opening a prior-version drawing in AutoCAD Civil 3D 2015 ,  and then editing the properties of a subassembly that uses a custom PKT file ,  will result in the subassembly not being found when you re-open the drawing in a prior version of the application  ( even if you do not save the drawing in AutoCAD Civil 3D 2015 )  .

To change global spell-checking options ,  you must have a misspelled word in the report . 
 { 1 } Meshing { 2 } 
 { 1 } General / User Interface { 2 } 
You cannot edit the red word in the "Not in dictionary" field within the Spelling dialog box . 
Then you can switch to another design scenario . 
The Spell Checker doesn't work in the Captions field when adding images or videos . 
When this happens ,  the spelling suggestions and actions are not applicable to the originally selected word . 
You cannot change to another design scenario in the Results environment while simultaneously running an MES and other design scenarios .  
You have to left-click on a misspelled word and then right-click to display the spelling suggestion . 
There is currently no known workaround for this issue .  
Also ,  trying to delete the embedded presentation fails .  
 { 1 } Results Environment { 2 } 
Currently ,  you cannot turn off spell checking .  
 { 1 }  for information about new functionality in Simulation CFD ,  please see the  { 2 } /view/SCDSE/2015/ENU/?guid=GUID-2426C8BE-99E3-4775-9691-6D788E46F365 { 3 } What's New .  { 4 } 
When running transient analyses  ( like MES )  ,  if you cancel an analysis half way through ,  the Results Environment will be grayed out .  
 ( See note below .  ) 
 { 1 } Report Environment { 2 } 
To download and install the plugin ,  go to  { 1 } http : //ceetron . com/products/end-user-products/glview-3d-plugin { 2 } http : //ceetron . com/products/end-user-products/glview-3d-plugin { 3 }  .  
When you right-click on a misspelled word and choose to access the Spelling dialog box from the context menu ,  the selected word may change .  
 { 1 } April 9 ,  2014 { 2 } 
 { 1 } Nonlinear / Mechanical Event Simulation  ( MES )  { 2 } 
If you want to access the already calculated results ,  you can run "Check Model" for the design scenario and access the Results Environment . 
For information about new functionality in Simulation Mechanical ,  please see the  { 1 } /view/ASMECH/2015/ENU/?guid=GUID-C9445E77-C74D-4769-94C0-C09570F92ABE { 2 } What's New { 3 }  . 
Since only an English dictionary is provided ,  most words will be marked as misspelled for customers using non-English languages . 
If new design scenarios with different analysis types are created from a linear static stress analysis in which graphing was attempted ,  the graphing functions can fail for those analysis types as well .  
In a linear static stress analysis ,  when you attempt to graph results or create a path plot ,  a blank graph may appear  ( with no curve ,  title ,  or legend displayed ;  and with an incorrect Y-axis range )  .  
 { 1 } Simulation CFD Interoperability { 2 } 
As a workaround ,  deactivate the "Results Contours > Load Case Options > Analysis in Progress" option .  
You cannot close the Results environment .  
When this occurs ,  double-click a Saved Presentation to open a new results window .  
The "Include data labels" option is missing from the context menu for Local Mesh Refinement convergence plots . 
In a linear static stress analysis ,  when you attempt to embed a graph ,  the presentation window becomes blank and cannot be closed .  
Spell Checker will always display a red line under a word until you press the Space bar or a punctuation mark . 
To prevent this problem ,  do not attempt to use the graphing functions for linear static stress analysis results . 
 { 1 } CAD Interoperability { 2 } 
Then ,  click View > Windows > Arrange > Cascade .  
You can then close the blank window and maximize the new presentation window .  
For information about new functionality in Moldflow Insight ,  please see the  { 1 } /view/MFIWS/2015/ENU/?guid=GUID-9398A358-79E6-4696-833A-90BEE0AB5A2F { 2 } What's New .  { 3 }

Select Yes ,  if you would like all of your assets checked out from Vault to be writable . 
When you select the BOM command ,  you can then choose to check out asset files in order to modify them in a BOM . 
Select Apply key parameters to observe and sort similar-looking assets in your BOM . 
This will change files that are being controlled in Vault to a read-only status . 
If you don't select the check box under Factory Options ,  you can also choose to add key parameters under the BOM Control . 
You can also open your BOM assets without changing their read-only attributes . 
Before generating your BOM ,  set your asset files to either writeable or read only .  
If you choose the Asset Control command ,  and then Restore all asset files to read-only status ,  the dialog below will remind you to check in your files manually .  
If all asset files are checked out ,  they are all writable .

On the other hand ,  if the user clicks "Asset Control" command ,  chooses "Restore all asset files to read-only status" option and clicks OK button ,  dialog below pops up : 
To return to the default format ,  just select Reset BOM Layout . 
If your files are writeable ,  you can modify them in your BOM .  
If you choose this option ,  your Vault assets will retain their read-only status . 
If you set your files to read only ,  your assets will be grayed out and non-editable . 
The three main functions contained in the BOM command include asset control ,  resetting your BOM layout ,  and generation of your BOM . 
Select No ,  if you would like only your local assets to be writable .  
You also have the option to make asset files ,  and sub-layout files ,  writeable for editing .  
After editing your BOM files ,  be sure to check them in manually in order to see your changes reflected . 
Select the checkbox under Bill of Materials to show the asset’s key parameters once your BOM generated .  
You can freely modify the format of your BOM by re-ordering ,  adding ,  and removing columns .

Images in the schedule cannot show in schedule view
Symptom :  { 1 }   A crash with Customer Error Report  ( CER )  dialog occurs on Windows 8 . 1 when placing an image or an element containing an image  ( such as a schedule )  on a sheet .  { 2 } 
Issue :  { 1 }   Revit attempts to use multi-threading to process images within a view .  
Solution :  { 1 }   Specify the height of all rows containing images after you place the schedule onto sheet view .  
Issue :  { 1 }   The associated images can only be shown in the schedule graphics in a sheet view ,  they cannot be shown in any other view .  { 2 } 
Symptom :  { 1 }   After you added images in the schedule view ,  only the image names are shown .  { 2 } 
Solution :  { 1 }   Limit adding images with hundreds of megabytes into the Revit file .  { 2 } 
Solution :   { 1 } If the preview image is needed ,  open the family for editing ,  and then save the family file by save or save-as command .  { 2 } 
In some cases this approach may introduce instability on Windows 8 or 8 . 1 .  { 1 }  { 2 }  { 3 } 
Part Families
Adjust image column width in schedules
Families saved from project browser do not have preview image . 
Symptom :  { 1 }   When you adjust image column width in schedules ,  the schedule instances in the sheet view might overlap with other viewports in the vertical direction .  { 2 } 
Symptom :   { 1 } If a family file  (  . rfa )  is saved from project browser ,  it does not have preview image in windows explorer .  
Solution :  { 1 }   After you added images to schedules ,  please drag the schedules to sheet view to check if the images are correct .  { 2 } 
Symptom :  { 1 }   After you added images in the Manage Images dialog ,  you will find the Revit file size may increase .  { 2 } 
Issue :    { 1 } Preview image is not correctly being generated and saved within the part family .  { 2 } 
Issue :  { 1 }   Revit will scale the image by aspect ratio by default ,  so when you adjust the image column width ,  the image height will also be changed and thus the image row height will also be changed .  { 2 } 
Then ,  the image height will be constrained to fixed height when you adjusting the image column width .  { 1 } 
Add images in the Manage Images dialog
Views containing Images may cause instability on Windows 8 and 8 . 1 when placed on sheets
Issue :  { 1 }   When you added images in the Manage Images dialog to project ,  Revit will import the images rather than link them .  { 2 } 
Also it cannot show preview image in “Load Component” dialog in Revit .  { 1 } 
Solution :  { 1 }   Import the data in Revit 2014 and copy the resulting import to a 2015 model ,  or ,  return to the authoring application to tweak the geometry of this surface so it can import properly .  { 2 } 
Issue :  { 1 }  Revit may appear to hang during save or Save With Central if the workstation’s rsn . ini file lists servers that do not exist ,  though the operation will eventually succeed given enough time .  { 2 } 
Symptom :  { 1 }   Call to API “GET / { modelPath } /thumbnail?width= { width } &height= { height } ” constantly fails with receiving status code 500 and status description “ExtractModelThumbnailFailed” .  
[PerformanceOptimizations]
  Editing the ifc . rvt file is not recommended because it could cause problems with the hosting file .  { 1 } 
Symptom :  { 1 }   Sporadic crash may occur when using the “X”  ( close )  button during Raytrace .  { 2 } 
Solution :  { 1 }   Stop Raytracing before closing Revit .  { 2 } 
Solution :  { 1 }   The IFC Link functionality is intended to allow referencing the linked geometry ,  so those abilities are limited . 
Elements from a bound IFC Link cannot be edited
Symptom :  { 1 }   Unable to edit elements from a bound IFC Linked file .  { 2 } 
ParallelImageLODCreation = Off
  { 1 } Issue :   { 2 } The user may receive the Operation Could Not Be Completed message in response to certain operations if Revit has been idle for more than 10 minutes and there has been a large change to the model’s permissions state  ( e . g .  ,  a request placed for a very large number of elements .  ) 
Solution :  { 1 }   Pin the link and create reference planes for the elements you need to reference ,  then use those reference planes to snap or dimension .  { 2 } 
To import them ,  use AutoCAD to convert them into polymesh objects and reimport . ”
Issue :  { 1 }  The only known cause that could result in such constant failure is that the server doesn’t have “Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable  ( x64 ) ” installed ,  which is required by the functionality of extracting model thumbnails .  
Display of worksets or editing requests fails for large models after Revit has been idle
Work-Around or Solution :  { 1 }  Remove the non-existent servers from the rsn . ini .  { 2 } 
Symptom :  { 1 }   Stop button doesn’t work for the first time ,  clicking it restarts Raytrace .  { 2 } 
Intermittent application instability when closing Revit with real-time Raytrace active
Import of SAT or DWG files with 3D content exclude complex spline faces
Linked IFC files
Symptom :  { 1 }   Cannot snap or dimension to elements in a linked IFC .  { 2 } 
Unfortunately there is no additional information except for a corresponding exception dump in AdminRESTService . log at server side .  { 1 } 
Raytrace
Symptom :  { 1 }   Import of SAT files or DWG files with 3D content may not bring in shapes with complex spline faces ,  where that import succeeded in Revit 2014 .  { 2 } 
  Portions of the file unaffected by this error will import as usual .  { 1 } 
Symptom :  { 1 }  Poor response or performance when saving a local copy of a server-based model ,  or when attempting a Save With Central to a server-based model . 
Then reload the link and the cache file will be recreated and the link will update .  { 1 } 
Issue :  { 1 }   Binding an IFC Link creates elements in the project that cannot host elements or be edited ,  cut ,  joined ,  added to an assembly or turned into parts .  
We’ve identified that this redistributable is missed in Revit Server installation .  { 1 } 
Symptom :  { 1 }   Revit displays an “Operation Could Not Be Completed” message after the user invokes the worksets dialog or editing requests dialog .  { 2 } 
Symptom :  { 1 }   IFC Links appear not to reload or do not delete existing linked geometry .  { 2 } 
Solution :  { 1 }   Stop Raytracing by clicking on View ,  not Stop button . 
IFC Links appear not to reload or do not delete
Extracting Model Thumbnails Constantly Fails
Systems may be split when editing Fire Protection ,  Other and Vent systems
Unable to snap to elements in a linked IFC file
 ( It will be in the same directory as the IFC file .  )  
  { 1 } Work-Around or Solution :   { 2 } Retry the operation ;  the operation should succeed on the second attempt . 
Issue :  { 1 }   Elements in a linked IFC file cannot be used for functions that require dimensions ,  snapping ,  or align .  { 2 } 
First use of stop button does not halt real-time Raytrace
Symptom :  { 1 }   When editing a system that uses a Fire Protection ,  Other or Vent System Classification ,  the system may split into multiple systems if it contains networks that are not attached to equipment ,  fixtures or sprinkler heads .  { 2 } 
Solution :  { 1 }   Manually install “Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable  ( x64 ) ” on the server .  { 2 } 
Issue :  { 1 }   In rare cases when an IFC link is reloaded the linked model does not appear to change ,  or if Reload From is used ,  the geometry from both may be displayed . 
Issue :  { 1 }   Legacy issue ,  Revit shutting down process in progress while Raytacing on separate thread is still running .  { 2 } 
Solution :    { 1 } Change the Calculations level of these system types to None .  { 2 } 
Solution :  { 1 }   Add the following to the Revit . ini .  { 2 } 
Poor response when saving models in the Revit Server Network due to an incorrect rsn . ini
Issue :  { 1 }   A warning dialog will show during the import :  “Some ACIS objects could not be imported .  
Solution :  { 1 }   Delete the ifc . rvt cache file that corresponds to the linked IFC file .  
Revit Server - Admin REST API
DWG and SAT import 
This will also be the case if the corresponding ifc . rvt cache file is opened .  { 1 }

The target product is always 3ds Max Design or Showcase .  
Different workflows are provided with each source product ,  and workflows can be optimized for specific purposes ,  such as high-quality rendering or lighting analysis . 
Suite workflow
Building Design Suite
The workflows supplied with a suite can vary according to the suite level  ( standard ,  premium ,  or ultimate )  .  
A suite workflow is a mechanism for exporting an engineered design from a source Autodesk product to a target product for detailed rendering or animation .  
Infrastructure Design Suite
You can use workflows to prepare for design reviews and to create vivid presentations . 
Workflows are available from the main application menu :  Click Application menu  { 1 }  Suite Workflows . 
Enterprise users with eFlex or Term Multi-Flex licenses are authorized to use any of the workflows . 
The Showcase Constraint Animation workflow shows a mechanical assembly in motion ,  converting the range constraints into animated behaviors .  
Design Suite
For example ,  the 3ds Max Design Exterior Rendering workflow renders the external surfaces of a building design ,  including light and shadow .  
Workflows are provided with the following Autodesk suites : 
Settings in the workflow automatically transform the design objects for presentation in 3ds Max Design or Showcase .  
A workflow applies pre-selected settings in 3ds Max Design or Showcase to the design data from the source product  ( AutoCAD ,  Inventor ,  or Revit )  .  
Depending on the suite ,  the source product is either AutoCAD ,  Inventor ,  or Revit .  
Plant Design Suite
After you identify workflows that demonstrate best practices ,  share them with other team members to support consistent processes . 
Paste the Source path in a convenient location for adding to an email ,  or otherwise communicating to your team members .  
Navigate to the Source directory and copy the new workflow for distribution to your team . 
Create workflow
Right-click the highlighted Source entry  { 1 }  Copy . 
They will need to place the workflow in the comparable locations on their computers . 
Click Application menu  { 1 }  Suite WorkflowsWorkflow Manager . 
In Workflow Manager ,  right-click the workflow to use as a template for your custom workflow  { 1 }  Duplicate .  
In the Workflow Settings Editor ,  modify any workflow settings as required . 
In the Save Workflow Settings dialog ,  enter a unique name and description for the new workflow .  
If you want to share the new workflow with your team ,  follow the next steps . 
Right-click the Source entry  { 1 }  Select All . 
Click Workflow menu  { 1 }  Show Workflow Browser . 
Select the new workflow and then click Settings . 
At the bottom of the Workflow Settings Editor ,  click Save As . 
At the top of the Workflow Settings Editor ,  click Information .  
Open Workflow Manager using one of these methods : 
In the About section ,  the Source entry shows the path to the new workflow and other user workflows .  
To create and share a user workflow
The new workflow is added to the list ,  with a digit appended to the name ,  such as  ( 1 )  . 
The default location is C : /Users/<username>/AppData/Roaming/Autodesk/Workflows . 
You can create a workflow based on one of the standard workflows supplied by Autodesk ,  or based on another user workflow .  
Use this procedure to send your design to 3ds Max Design .  
Open the design document in the source application . 
Click the workflow you want to run . 
After some processing ,  your design appears in the target application . 
Before running a workflow ,  ensure that the design contains only the required objects ,  and any layers not required are turned off or frozen . 
In the workflow dialog ,  click Run . 
To run a workflow
Respond to any prompts that appear . 
Click Application menu  { 1 }  Suite Workflows . 
Run suite workflow
If it is not already open ,  the target application opens . 
Control which object types to display properties for on the Quick Properties palette and control the properties to display for that object on the Quick Properties palette .

A polymer valve gate system is used to control : 
Valve gate guidelines
Each valve gate controller should have a unique name to identify it .  
The same valve gate controller can be assigned to more than one hot gate or overflow well element .  
You should either model the feed system ahead of the valve gate ,  or ensure that the gate is meshed with more than one element along its length and then assign the valve gate to the gate element attached to the part . 
Valve gates can only be used in conjunction with hot runners  ( See picture above )  . 
Valve gate uses
To ensure you have set the correct controller at each gate ,  use a different property name for each valve gate controller and gate element . 
You cannot set a valve gate directly onto a runner .  
In order to set a valve gate ,  you must first select an existing hot gate or overflow well element . 
For Gas-assisted Fill+Pack analysis ,  a valve gate can also be assigned to an overflow well  ( modeled using Midplane or beam elements for Midplane models ,  and tetrahedral elements for 3D models )  . 
Cavity pressure . 
Valve gate controllers operate independently .  
How the cavity fills . 
A polymer valve gate system opens and closes the gate with assistance of hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders .  
Polymer valve gates are used with a hot runner design in order to control how the cavity is filled ,  and to regulate the flow through each gate . 
One valve gate does not have the ability to close when the flow front reaches another valve gate . 
Flashing and drooling . 
The properties that you assign to the valve gate controller specify the initial state and on/off timings of the valve gate . 
A valve gate is assigned to a hot gate or overflow well element by selecting a  { 1 } valve gate controller { 2 }  on the  { 3 } Valve Control { 4 }  tab of the properties dialog for the element .  
There is no limit on the number of valve gates that can be assigned to a model . 
A valve gate must be assigned to a  { 1 } single { 2 }  hot gate element in each hot drop .  
A valve gate must not be assigned to the same element as an injection location .  
This topic details some issues to remember when setting polymer valve gates .

The following three standard guides provide information and procedures that apply to most Autodesk products : 
Education Suites Installation Supplement
Each Education Suite uses a single installer that offers three product licensing options : 
The Master Suite license is activated when the first product is launched ,  and most other suite products are automatically registered to that license .  
Some of the products in this suite do not support standard functionality ,  as described below . 
Suite Workflows provide a convenient method of rendering designs in 3ds Max and Showcase .  
If you create an Education Master Suite deployment for stand-alone licensing ,  do not include Simulation CFD ,  as it will cause the suite installation to fail .  
For stand-alone licensing of Simulation CFD ,  run the installer separately on each computer .  
When using the Install Tools and Utilities function ,   { 1 } Vault Basic 2015  ( Server )  { 2 }  is selected by default for installation .  
Attempting to run ReCap in one of these ways can cause the product to crash or to display an alert message and exit . 
If you install  { 1 } Revit { 2 }  Server { 3 }  ,  these workflows are installed automatically in the installed design source products  ( AutoCAD ,  Inventor ,  and Revit )  .  
If it is not required ,  users should un-select it . 
An alternative installation method is available if you have access to the Education Master Suite installation files on media or in a downloaded folder .  
Other Product Notes
If the  { 1 } Robot { 2 }  Structural Analysis Professional { 3 }  Software Development Kit  ( SDK )  is installed on a computer that does not have Visual Studio or Microsoft Office installed ,  the SDK will be unable to install documentation for the Application Programming Interface  ( API )  .  
 { 1 } Simulation CFD { 2 }  does not support license timeout ,  serial number update ,  Enterprise Flex Cloud Licensing ,  stand-alone deployments ,  or combined 32- and 64-bit deployments .  
The exceptions are  { 1 } Autodesk { 2 }  Factory Design Suite Utility { 3 }  and  { 4 } Simulation CFD { 5 }  .  
This documentation requires Microsoft H2 Runtime ,  which is part of the Microsoft Developer Network  ( MSDN )  Library . 
If you create an Education Master Suite deployment for Windows 8 ,  either network licensed or stand-alone ,  do not include Simulation CFD ,  as it will cause the suite installation to fail .  
During uninstallation ,  the user is prompted to close the Windows Explorer process ,  to uninstall the shell extensions . 
 { 1 } ReCap { 2 }  does not work with virtual machines ,  or in a remote desktop session .  
If you are installing  { 1 } Simulation CFD { 2 }  on Windows 8 or 8 . 1 ,  you must run the installer file  { 3 } Setup . exe { 4 }  as an Administrator . 
To run Simulation CFD on Windows 8 ,  install it from the media ,  not by deployment . 
The downloaded folder created by Download Manager or Browser Download contains the Suite Workflows installer . 
Running Master Suite Installer as Administrator
Installing  { 1 } Inventor { 2 }  or  { 3 } Vault { 4 }  will install DWGTrueView ,  which also installs a shell extension that is loaded with Windows Explorer .  
Shortcuts created for  { 1 } Raster Design { 2 }  plugins do not get removed on uninstallation and must be manually deleted . 
These both require activation on first launch ,  using the Master Suite serial number and product key . 
To install Suite Workflows ,  open the suite installation files ,  navigate to  { 1 } Content\Workflows\x64 { 2 }  on a 64-bit operating system or  { 3 } Content\Workflows\x86 { 4 }  on a 32-bit system ,  and then double-click the MSI file ,  either  { 5 } Workflow_x64 . msi { 6 }  or  { 7 } Workflow_x86 . msi { 8 }  .

Autodesk has tested and officially supports the current and three previous versions of Autodesk Revit ,  Autodesk Revit Architecture ,  Autodesk Revit MEP ,  Autodesk Revit Structure ,  and Autodesk Revit LT running under the current and three previous versions of Parallels Desktop for Mac .  
Can I install Autodesk Revit ,  Autodesk Revit Architecture ,  Autodesk Revit MEP ,  Autodesk Revit Structure ,  or Autodesk Revit LT on a Mac computer?
Can I install Autodesk Revit ,  Autodesk Revit { 1 }   { 2 } Architecture ,  Autodesk Revit { 3 }   { 4 } MEP ,  Autodesk Revit Structure ,  or Autodesk Revit LT on a Mac computer?
You can install Windows { 1 } ® { 2 }  on a Mac computer with an Intel® CPU by partitioning the hard drive .  
Note :  { 1 }  To complete the install process ,  you will need the Mac Operating System installation media to provide the necessary Windows drivers .  { 2 } 
If you use Autodesk Revit ,  Autodesk Revit Architecture ,  Autodesk Revit MEP ,  and Autodesk Revit Structure ,  on the Boot Camp partition through Parallels on the same computer and expect to make hardware configuration changes you should use network licensing .  
Autodesk has not tested and does not support using products based on the Revit { 1 } ® { 2 }  platform with other virtualization software . 
For Autodesk Revit LT you may only use stand-alone licensing ,  therefore running the Boot Camp partition through Parallels is not recommended in this configuration .   
You can use either a standalone or network license of Autodesk Revit ,  Autodesk Revit Architecture ,  Autodesk Revit MEP ,  and Autodesk Revit Structure ;  but using the system as the network license server is not supported .  
Once you have installed and configured Parallels Desktop ,  start Parallels Desktop and then start Autodesk Revit ,  Autodesk Revit Architecture ,  Autodesk Revit MEP ,  Autodesk Revit Structure ,  or Autodesk Revit LT { 1 }   { 2 } in a window .  
For Autodesk Revit LT ,  only standalone licensing is available .  
The workaround is to use single byte characters for the Operating System’s User Name . 
Error 1722 will occur ,  if you install Product Design Suite 2015 on a machine that has Product Design Suite 2014 installed and it’s Operating System’s User Name contains double byte characters .  
This issue is reproducible in German/Spanish/Czech/Brazilian Portuguese/Russian languages . 
Reuse 2D Data function is not available for “ . dwg” files ,  a warning dialog will occur when opening a drawing file from Reuse 2D Data on Workflow tab .  
Resolved an issue with the Item BOM effective start date that would result in Error 1417 ,  "No Effective BOM for the date provided' . 
User is required to save using the CAD application before check in is permitted . 
Open the Vault Explorer config file with a text editor . 
Vault Basic - Connectivity . Vault . exe . Config
Add the line <add key="DWFPublisher . OpenInventorAssemblyInLastActiveLevelOfDetailRepresentation" value="True" /> . 
Vault Professional - Connectivity . VaultPro . exe . config
Locate the <appSettings> section . 
NOTE :  { 1 }  The following  ( optional )  change to the Vault Explorer config file or 'JobProcessor . exe . config' is required to complete the 'LOD' update . 
VaAc_addin . arx
Example ;  'C : \Program Files\Autodesk\Vault Professional 2013\Explorer' . 
Connectivity . Explorer . Item . dll
Vault Workgroup - Connectivity . VaultWkg . exe . Config
NOTE :  { 1 }  The following change to the appropriate Vault Explorer config file is required to complete the 'Open with Viewer' update . 
The Vault Explorer config file is named as follows ; 
Vault Explorer and Job Processor can now be configured to create DWFs that display the last used LOD instead of defaulting to the Master LOD . 
DwfGenerator . dll
When saving DWGs in a legacy file format ,  the prompt to save upon check in to Vault could result in file corruption .  
Resolved an issue where the DWF 'Publish Count' was not being honored by Job Processor . 
Resolved a display issue with Item BOM where standard components referenced by multiple assemblies may have repeated revisions shown in the BOM tab . 
Using the above procedure ,  edit the appropriate Vault Explorer config file and/or 'JobProcessor . exe . config' . 
Using Windows Explorer ,  navigate to the location of the Vault Explorer config file .  
New For This Release { 1 }  { 2 }  { 3 }  :  The new Autodesk Application Manager will automatically notify you that an Update is available before going to the Web to download the service pack . 
To uninstall the Autodesk AutoCAD Map 3D 2015 Service Pack 1 ,  use the Uninstall a program for Windows 7 or Windows 8/8 . 1 .  Expand your window to see the updates and then select the service pack to remove it . 
2 .  { 1 }      { 2 }  { 3 }  { 4 } If you install the service pack by a DVD ,  you will need the DVD for uninstalling the service pack because it needs to find the acadmap . msi during the uninstallation . 
If you are going to open the DWG files from Launchapd using “AutoCAD Block Converter” command in Workflows tab ,  an error dialog will pop up ,  then the DWG file can’t be opened in Inventor .  
Launchpad : 
Please go to Inventor product ,  select Open command and select a DWG file ,  click “Option” and choose “import” option to open the DWG file .

Use Vault 2012 with a Proxy Server
If a client machine connects to the web server through a proxy server ,  then all calls to the Autodesk Vault Server from any Autodesk client will fail .

Change the Proxy Settings in Internet Explorer 7 . x ,  8 . x
All addresses without a period ,  for example :   { 1 } http : //webserver { 2 }  ,  bypass the proxy and are resolved directly . 
If Internet Explorer continues to connect to the assigned HTTP proxy server ,  check to see if the HTTP proxy address contains a period .  
If it does ,  configure the proxy server to use a host name .

Type or copy  { 1 } the following code in the code editor window :  { 2 } 
Preliminary Setup
The iLogic Browser will appear
The renamed parameters are important to our shaft configuration .  
You will now create a rule that defines exactly what you want the previously created parameters to do . 
The code will look for the selected value of  { 1 } the “Classification” parameter and adjust the “OA_Length” parameter  { 2 } accordingly
Name the new rule “ { 1 } Config_Rules { 2 } ” and select  { 3 } OK  { 4 } on the Rule Name dialog box
When you have finished click “ { 1 } OK { 2 } ” to  { 3 } dismiss the Value List Editor .  { 4 } 
For this exercise ,  make sure that  { 1 } PrDS Test Drive . ipj  { 2 } is set as the active project in Inventor prior to starting the steps .

OA_Length  { 1 } = 355  { 2 }  { 3 } mm { 4 } 
On the  { 1 } Manage Tab click “ { 2 }  { 3 } Add Rule { 4 }  { 5 } ” on the  { 6 } iLogic tile
Most of the parameters are now filtered from the list . 
Confirm that the PrDS Test Drive project appears in the Projects dialog and is marked with a check . 
This parameter currently does not have a related rule associated with it ,  so modifying the value will not have any effect on the model . 
The new parameter is created with an  { 1 } option to select “True” or “False” in  { 2 } the equation column .  
You will define that later . 
 { 1 } Name the parameter  { 2 } “ { 3 } Classification { 4 } ”  { 5 } and mark it as  { 6 } “ { 7 } Key { 8 } ”
Click the small down-arrow and select  { 1 } “ { 2 }  { 3 } Add True/False { 4 }  { 5 } ” { 6 }  . 
Notice how the length of the shaft changes in response to the parameter change according to the rule .

Exercise1 :  Model Based Automation
 { 1 } This parameter currently does not have a related action associated with it .  
Some of the values are functions ,  mathematical formulas that reflect design intent for that feature .  
OA_Length  { 1 } = 325  { 2 }  { 3 } mm { 4 } 
You can position the browser anywhere on the screen or dock it along the left or right side of the Inventor window . 
Page  { 1 } 10 { 2 } 
 { 1 } On the third line enter  { 2 } “ { 3 } Light_Duty { 4 } ”
In addition to the numeric parameters you will  { 1 } also create two additional “User Parameters” { 2 } 
A complex model could have many parameters to sort through .  
Name the new parameter “ { 1 } Fillet { 2 } ” and mark it as “ { 3 } Key { 4 } ”
This designation allows us to filter the parameter list to make is easier to work with . 
The new parameter is created ,  but the equation is not yet defined
Select “ { 1 } Done { 2 } ” to dismiss the Parameters  { 3 } dialog box .  { 4 } 
Notice how they have been  { 1 } marked as “key” parameters via the checkmarks  { 2 } in the  { 3 } “Key”  { 4 } column .  
Click  { 1 } Done { 2 }  . 
The values are now equations in the  { 1 } “Classification” parameter .

The code syntax to modify the thread feature was taken from the iLogic Snippet Library . 
 { 1 } ElseIf  { 2 }  { 3 } Classification  { 4 }  { 5 } =  { 6 } "Normal_Duty"  { 7 } Then  { 8 }  { 9 } iProperties { 10 }  { 11 }  . 
In the iLogic form editor window ,  change the name of the form to “ { 1 } Chassis Configurator { 2 } ”
 { 1 } ElseIf  { 2 }  { 3 } Classification  { 4 }  { 5 } =  { 6 }  { 7 } "Heavy_Duty"  { 8 }  { 9 } Then  { 10 }  { 11 } Thread_Dia  { 12 }  { 13 } = 72  { 14 } mm  { 15 } Feature . ThreadDesignation { 16 }  (  { 17 } "Thread1" { 18 }  )  =  { 19 } "M72x6"  { 20 }  { 21 } OA_Length  { 22 }  { 23 } = 355  { 24 } mm
If  { 1 } Assy_Config  { 2 }  { 3 } =  { 4 }  { 5 } "Light_Duty"  { 6 } Then
Change the label to read “ { 1 } Bucket Style { 2 } ” .

Right-Mouse-Click on the Config_Rule in the iLogic Browser and select  { 1 } “ { 2 }  { 3 } Edit Rule { 4 }  { 5 } ” { 6 }  . 
Launch the Parameter Editor . 
You will now create a rule that modifies several  { 1 } Inventor iProperties when the “Classification”  { 2 } parameter is changed . 
Test the rule . 
The code will evaluate the condition of the  { 1 } “Assy_Config” paramete { 2 } r . 
 { 1 }  { 2 } IsActive { 3 }  (  { 4 } "_bucket PK46 . 80 . 00 . 000 : 1" { 5 }  )  =  { 6 } False  { 7 }  { 8 } Else { 9 } 
On the Manage Tab select “ { 1 } Parameters { 2 } ” to  { 3 } view the model parameters dialog box .  { 4 } 
 { 1 } The form button will appear in the iLogic browser .  { 2 } 
The values for this parameter will be used to activate different position representations of the chassis . 
ElseIf  { 1 } Classification  { 2 }  { 3 } =  { 4 }  { 5 } "Heavy_Duty"  { 6 } Then
 { 1 } Parameter { 2 }  (  { 3 } "PK46-25-00-002-Complete : 1" ,  "Inner_Dia" { 4 }  )  = 95  { 5 } mm { 6 } 
The code syntax to modify suppression was taken from the iLogic Snippet Library . 
The parameter “ { 1 } Thread_Dia { 2 } ” will be  { 3 } modified by a parameter change .  { 4 } 
 { 1 } If  { 2 }  { 3 } Chassis_Config  { 4 } =  { 5 } "Rake Bucket"  { 6 }  { 7 } Then  { 8 }  { 9 } Component { 10 }  { 11 }  . 
The parameter is evaluated and the components are modified according to the embedded rule code . 
Outer_Dia  { 1 } = 80  { 2 }  { 3 } mm  { 4 } Thread_Length  { 5 } = 40  { 6 }  { 7 } mm { 8 } 
 { 1 } IsActive { 2 }  (  { 3 }  { 4 } "_bucket PK46 . 80 . 00 . 100 : 1" { 5 }  { 6 }  )  =  { 7 }  { 8 } False  { 9 } Component { 10 }  . 
Activate the Forms Tab on the iLogic Rules Browser . 
Notice how the shaft changes in response to the parameter change according to the rule . 
Define the image for the picture in the form element properties window . 
The “Inner_Dia” parameter of the Flange  { 1 } Ring will be adjusted accordingly .  { 2 } 
When one of these subassemblies is active the other will be suppressed . 
ElseIf  { 1 } Classification  { 2 }  { 3 } =  { 4 }  { 5 } "Normal_Duty"  { 6 } Then
Replace the old code by typing or copying the following code in the code editor window : 
You can now use this form to quickly toggle between bucket configurations and positional representations . 
“Scoop”  { 1 } style { 2 } 
The shaft changes in response to the parameter change according to the rule . 
Click “ { 1 } OK { 2 } ” to dismiss the iLogic Rule Editor { 3 }  .  { 4 } 
 { 1 }  { 2 } Value { 3 }  (  { 4 } "Project" ,  "Description" { 5 }  { 6 }  )   { 7 } =  { 8 } "Heavy Duty Pin" { 9 } 
The iProperties of the shaft are updated according to the rule . 
The code used in this rule was derived from advanced information found in the Inventor Application Programing Interface . 
Outer_Dia  { 1 } = 95  { 2 }  { 3 } mm  { 4 } Thread_Length  { 5 } = 55  { 6 }  { 7 } mm { 8 } 
The code will evaluate the “Chassis_Config  { 1 } parameter and manage the suppression state of the bucket subassemblies .  { 2 } 
Next you will create an iLogic form to drive the two parameters . 
 { 1 } Value { 2 }  (  { 3 } "Project" ,  "Description" { 4 }  )   { 5 } =  { 6 }  { 7 } "Light Duty Pin" { 8 } 
Name the new rule “ { 1 } iProp_Rules { 2 } ” and  { 3 } select  { 4 }  { 5 } OK  { 6 }  { 7 } on the Rule Name dialog box { 8 }

The intent is to show how iLogic can be used to drive rules and modify model parameters from the assembly level . 
 { 1 } Value { 2 }  (  { 3 } "Project" ,  "Part Number" { 4 }  )   { 5 } =  { 6 } " { 7 } 295-L"  { 8 }  { 9 } iProperties { 10 }  . 
value of “OA_Length” ,  “Outer_Dia” and “Thread_Length” accordingly { 1 }  .  { 2 } 
ILogic requires a custom “Level of Detail”  { 1 } representation in order to manage component suppression .  { 2 } 
 { 1 } ElseIf  { 2 }  { 3 } Classification  { 4 } =  { 5 } "Heavy_Duty"  { 6 }  { 7 } Then  { 8 }  { 9 } iProperties { 10 }  { 11 }  . 
The new code will evaluate the  { 1 } “Classification” parameter and adjust the { 2 } 
OA_Length  { 1 } = 355  { 2 }  { 3 } mm  { 4 } Outer_Dia  { 5 } = 105  { 6 }  { 7 } mm  { 8 } Thread_Length  { 9 } = 60  { 10 }  { 11 } mm { 12 }

iLogic provides a powerful method for capturing internal standards and industry knowledge within the digital prototype ,  allowing the user to quickly make large-scale changes at the assembly level . 
Close the file and do not save any changes . 
In this exercise ,  you develop an iLogic rule to configure several components of an assembly .  
The feature “Thread1” will be modified by a  { 1 } parameter change .  { 2 } 
The Shaft will change according to the rules from Exercise 1 .

Exercise2 :  Assembly Based Automation
Note :  The suppressed bucket will still be part of the assembly model but will be  { 1 } invisible and will be marked as “reference”  { 2 } in the Bill of Material and therefore will not be included in a drawing Parts List . 
A multi-value parameter called  { 1 } “ { 2 } Chassis { 3 } _Config” contains t { 4 } wo values :   { 5 } “ { 6 } Scoop Bucket { 7 } ”  { 8 } and  { 9 } “ { 10 } Rake Bucket { 11 } ” { 12 }  . 
Outer_Dia  { 1 } = 105  { 2 }  { 3 } mm  { 4 } Thread_Length  { 5 } = 60  { 6 }  { 7 } mm { 8 } 
Test the rule
Click “ { 1 } OK { 2 } ” to dismiss the iLogic Rule editor
Note the changes in the form preview . 
 { 1 } Parameter { 2 }  (  { 3 } "PK46-25-00-003-Complete : 1" ,  "Classification" { 4 }  )  =  { 5 } "Normal_Duty" { 6 } 
Select “ { 1 } Done { 2 } ” to dismiss the Parameters  { 3 } dialog .  { 4 } 
The Flange Ring will respond accordingly . 
Type or copy  { 1 } the following code into the code editor window :  { 2 } 
\iLogic\Exercise_2 and open
The “Classification” parameter in the Shaft  { 1 } component will be changed accordingly  ( thus the rule you built in Exercise 1 will make adjustments to several other parmeters .  { 2 } 
Make sure it is the active LOD . 
OA_Length  { 1 } = 325  { 2 }  { 3 } mm  { 4 } Outer_Dia  { 5 } = 95  { 6 }  { 7 } mm  { 8 } Thread_Length  { 9 } = 55  { 10 }  { 11 } mm { 12 } 
You will now create a rule that determines the bucket assembly to be used when the  { 1 } “Chassis_Config” parameter is  { 2 } modified . 
You will also create a simple iLogic form as a user interface for the assembly configuration . 
This rule will evaluate the “Classification”  { 1 } parameter and modify the Part Number and Description iProperties accordingly .  { 2 } 
 { 1 }  { 2 } Value { 3 }  { 4 }  (  { 5 } "Project" ,  "Part Number" { 6 }  )   { 7 }  { 8 } =  { 9 } "325-N"  { 10 } iProperties { 11 }  { 12 }  . 
iLogic_Assy_START . IAM
A multi- { 1 } value parameter called “ { 2 } Position { 3 } ”  { 4 } contains three  { 5 } values :  “ { 6 } Master { 7 } ” ,  “Raised”  { 8 } and  { 9 } “ { 10 } Lowered { 11 } ” { 12 }  . 
In addition to the previous conditions you have added two additional modifications . 
 { 1 } Parameter { 2 }  (  { 3 } "PK46-25-00-003-Complete : 1" ,  "Classification" { 4 }  )  =  { 5 } "Heavy_Duty" { 6 } 
Name the new rule “ { 1 } Assy_Config { 2 } ” and  { 3 } select  { 4 }  { 5 } OK  { 6 }  { 7 } on the Rule Name dialog box { 8 } 
Right-Mouse-Click in the iLogic Browser and  { 1 } select “ { 2 }  { 3 } Add Form { 4 }  { 5 } ” { 6 }  . 
The iLogic Form Editor appears and enables you to build a form using existing rules ,  parameters and iProperties . 
 { 1 } Parameter { 2 }  (  { 3 } "PK46-25-00-002-Complete : 1" ,  "Inner_Dia" { 4 }  )  = 70  { 5 } mm { 6 }

This Service Pack can be applied to AutoCAD 2015 and AutoCAD LT 2015 installed as a standalone application as well as AutoCAD 2015 and AutoCAD LT 2015 installed from the following suites or bundled products . 
This Service Pack includes the  { 1 } http : //knowledge . autodesk . com/support/autocad/downloads/caas/downloads/content/autodesk-autocad-security-hotfix . html { 2 } Autodesk AutoCAD Security Hotfix { 3 }  .  
This Service Pack can be applied whether that security hotfix was originally applied to your system or not . 
If you have Autodesk ReCap 2015 installed together with AutoCAD 2015 ,  please install Autodesk ReCap 2015 Hotfix 1 via Autodesk Application Manager . 
Data in the vault can be reviewed ,  shared and published using Vault Explorer .   
Your design is checked out to your local workspace ,  where you can easily make the desired modifications .   
Vault Explorer shows the current version of the design by default ,  but the previous versions are still available if needed . 
After the modifications are complete ,  the design is checked back into the vault ,  updating the modified files to new versions .   
Vault access is integrated into design tools that make up the Product Design Suite .   
It securely stores and manages data in a central location helping teams quickly create ,  share and reuse digital prototyping information .   
A typical drawing update starts by checking out your design from the  { 1 } V { 2 } ault .   
You can also track the references of designs ,  showing what components are used or what references support the component . 
The corner stone to the Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk data management solution is Auto { 3 } d { 4 } esk Vault .   
 The Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Vault family of data management software helps you keep track of all of your digital design data . 
The secure and collaborative access to your design data is just one of the benefits to the digital prototyping workflow available in the Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Product Design Suite .   
You can quickly and precisely change parametric features and part geometry in models with complex histories ,  or easily edit the base features of imported solid models .   
In this example ,  a component of the frontloader is imported from another CAD application .   
Direct edits are dynamically added utilizing a simple pull- push manipulator . 
The direct edit ability for parametric control of model features ,  regardless of the originating CAD system ,  is a major workflow advantage offered by AutoDesk Product Design Suite .  
Some adjustments must be made in order to utilize this component on a new design .   
AutoDesk Inventor's  { 1 } DIRECT EDIT  { 2 } command allows you to parametrically move ,  size ,  rotate and delete imported styling models or native Inventor files . 
Whether you're working with native Inventor parts or imported parts from other CAD applications ,  it's often necessary to make permanent alterations or explore possible design alternatives . 
Even when model history is lost during translation ,  AutoDesk Product Design Suite allow designers to parametrically adjust the 3D model ,  updating it to the desired size and shape . 
Conventional features like fillets and chamfers can be applied to the freeform body after the desired form is established .  
Users start with freeform shape that best represents the desired geometry ,  like a box ,  sphere ,  cylinder ,  torus or quadball . 
The complex ergonomic shape of the handle is a perfect opportunity to utilize Product Design Suite's freeform design capabilities . 
 Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Product Design Suite offers an alternative freeform modeling method to easily generate these complex shapes . 
The freeform modeling tools available in Product Design Suite allow you to quickly explore designs and create organic shapes with intuitive push-pull commands that provide an experience very similar to sculpting clay .   
They then use freeform edit tools to manipulate and adjust the shape to suite . 
The ability to easily generate and edit any freeform shape is a major benefit of the complete digital prototyping solution offered with Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Product Design Suite . 
In this scenario ,  a lever handle is being developed for the shifter of a frontloader . 
Symmetry can be easily applied to the design ensuring that the adjustments on one side of a form are automatically reflected on the other .   
In this scenario ,  a large frontloader design is just a small part of digital mock-up of fabrication facility . 
It is often necessary to place your digital prototype into much larger digital mock-up .   
Navisworks allows designers to combine 3D models from many different CAD sources to a single digital environment .   
This capability allows you to experience the digital design long before actual fabrication or construction begins .   
The Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Product Design Suite utilizes Auto { 3 } d { 4 } esk Navisworks to accommodate models of incredible size consisting of thousands or millions of individual parts .   
The size of the Navisworks environment goes beyond the capability and capacity of most CAD offering systems .   
You can explore the digital mock-up using real-time fly-though and walk-through commands . 
Red-line mark-up and clash detection tools are also available ,  allowing you to easily discover interferences and notify all members of your collaborative team .   
The Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Product Design Suite is a quick tool to accommodate large detailed designs ,  like the frontloader ,  but it is important to note that it can also easily display the entire frontloader fabrication facility ,  if required . 
AutoCAD-centric annotations are easily added to the drawing utilizing AutoCAD Mechanical's  { 1 } POWER DIMENSION  { 2 } command . 
 The Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Product Design Suite allows engineers and designers to document the design in Auto { 3 } d { 4 } esk Inventor or AutoCAD Mechanical .   
In this scenario ,  a frontloader actuator design is modeled in Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Inventor ,  but the drawing documentation will be created in AutoCAD Mechanical .   
The drawing creation process if very simple .   
AutoCAD Mechanical can create drawing view of Inventor parts and assemblies .   
Traditional AutoCAD-centric workflows are an intricate part of many design and manufacturing processes .   
A base view is created along with the projection views ,  section views and isometric views .   
The versatility of documentation allows any AutoCAD-centric detail or annotation process to be included in the drawing file and is a very large benefit to the digital prototyping workflows available in the Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Product Design Suite .   
Power dimensions allow detailers to create linear ,  radius and diameter dimensions with a single AutoCAD command .   
If a change occurs in the original Inventor model ,  the AutoCAD Mechanical drawing views will automatically update ,  ensuring that your drawings always reflect the current state of the design . 
In this scenario ,  piping connections are added to the chiller's supply lines .   
In this scenario ,  an air conditioning chiller ,  created with Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Inventor ,  will be simplified and exported to Auto { 3 } d { 4 } esk Revit as a native Revit family file .   
The  { 1 } EXPORT BUILDING COMPONENTS  { 2 } command is then used to publish the Revit family file so it can be utilized with Auto { 3 } d { 4 } esk Revit as a valid building component . 
Many architectural designs rely on manufacturing models to support Building Information Modeling ,  or BIM ,  workflows .   
The simplification and BIM Exchange environments provide effective collaboration between architectural and manufacturing design teams and are a key benefit included in the Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Product Design Suit { 3 }  { 4 } e . 
The primary components are segregated into a simple design view ,  then the dominant features of the design are converted into bounding boxes or cylinders . 
The manufacturing model is far too complex for effective use in Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Revit . 
The simplification tools are used to generate the single part file that represents the assembly .   
The BIM exchange environment has commands for defining different types of connectors ,  such as conduit ,  duct ,  pipe and electrical . 
All features in the model browser are checked to assure compatibility with the Revit feature translation .   
When the simplified part is ready ,  the BIM Exchange process is initiated . 
Specific commands allow complex features to be manually converted into Revit-ready features ,  if necessary . 
The model needs to be simplified to it's basic design envelope before export . 
This process is greatly simplified by the  { 1 } JOINT  { 2 } command ,  which automatically interprets mechanical relationships based on selected geometry .   
Components are assembled together utilizing typical mechanical relationships called constraints .   
The entire actuator can be assembled with a single command and a simple heads-up display .   
In this exercise ,  you impose limits on the stroke motion of the actuator ,  so it behaves as intended . 
These assembly constraints provide an easy method to define and control the allowable motion of the component .   
During this short tutorial ,  you'll witness the simple assembly workflows utilized by Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Inventor and see how easily any mechanical relationship can be simulated in Auto { 3 } d { 4 } esk Product Design Suite .   
In this chapter ,  we introduce the simple ,  easy to learn assembly process utilized by AutoDesk Inventor while assembling an actuator used on an industrial frontloader . 
Once the actuator is complete ,  it is placed in the main frontloader assembly ,  where the stroke motion of the actuator limits the overall motion of the front chassis .   
The intuitive assembly modeling environment in Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk's Inventor enables users to design ,  validate and optimize complex machines used in industrial processes and specialty vehicles used in modern transportation systems consisting of assemblies of tens ,  or even hundreds of thousands of components .   
The ability to create rules that capture design intent and embed those rules into digital models ensures that all users on your team abide by established standards and produce designs that adhere to engineering guidelines . 
The iLogic editor allows you to easily reference design parameters ,  logical functions and a large library of predefined rules called “snippets” ,  to help build custom rules for your geometry . 
An iLogic user form is easily created providing quick access to the configuration parameters of the assembly .   
Inventor iLogic technology dramatically simplifies rules based design for any inventor user ,  even those with little or no programming experience .   
You will also work with a finished assembly where an iLogic rule controls which version of a bucket is used on a frontloader .   
As you work through this tutorial you will see the potential workflows available through iLogic and understand how powerful a digital prototype can be when embedded with predefined business and engineering rules ,  all supplied by the Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Product Design Suite . 
Inventor iLogic transforms the digital prototype into a truly intelligent asset that can quickly produce multiple design configurations while adhering to  predefined rules . 
iLogic technology allows designers to embed design intelligence ,  such as business and engineering rules into the digital model ,  so you can automate the order and bid process right at the point of sale . 
You will continue building a rule that will cause other components of the pin assembly to respond to the design change accordingly .   
In this chapter ,  you will incorporate some simple rules into the design of a fastening pin allowing you to control several aspects of the design by changing a single parameter . 
All features can be easily edited if changes occur . 
The easy creation of the 3D digital prototypes is the primary function of Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Inventor . 
The modeling process starts off by creating simple ,  intelligent sketches of base features .   
In this chapter we will show you how simple and easy it is to learn the modeling process in Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Inventor while developing a connector link ,  which is a component used in an industrial frontloader .   
A simple modification to a sketch parametrically updates the entire design .   
As you work through this chapter ,  you will experience the easy to learn modeling workflows offered by Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Inventor – the 3D mechanical design software at the core of Auto { 3 } d { 4 } esk Product Design Suite . 
Additional mechanical features can be easily placed in the design to complete the digital prototype .   
These sketches become the profiles used by the wide array of 3D modeling tools found in Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Inventor ,  enabling you to test form ,  fit and function of your digital prototype .   
Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Inventor is the premier 3D modeling solution at the core of the Auto { 3 } d { 4 } esk Product Design Suite ,  allowing you to validate the form ,  fit and function of the design before it is built .   
The cable and harness component of Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Product Design Suite provides the ability to create and manipulate a three dimensional wire harness in context of Inventor assemblies .   
The ability to utilize the 3D environment of Inventor and the 2D schematic environment of AutoCAD Electrical to design and route your harness components is a major benefit of the digital prototyping workflow available in the AutoDesk Product Design Suite . 
With the wires created ,  the autorouting capability of Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Inventor is used to route the wires to the nearest harness entry and exit locations .   
AutoCAD Electrical allows designers to easily create wire schematics in AutoCAD environment with electrical-centric commands and workflows .   
In this scenario ,  the physical connector data is harvested from the Inventor assembly and exported to AutoCAD Electrical .   
Once the schematic is complete ,  the point to point information is exported from AutoCAD Electrical back to Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Inventor ,  where it is used to automatically place wires in the assembly . 
With Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Inventor you can generate engineering and manufacturing documentation directly from the validated digital prototype ,  helping you minimize errors and deliver designs in less time . 
Change is a necessary part of any design process and can be a major setback for traditional drawing tools .   
A bill of material and balloons are also added to the actuator assembly drawing ,  making component identification and material management extremely simple . 
The drawings created by Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Inventor remain associated with the original models ,  automatically updating ,  when design changes occur .   
The complete and accurate manufacturing documentation of your design is a necessary step in any design process .    
In this chapter ,  we will document the part design of a connector link and the assembly layout of an actuator .   
Mechanical and manufacturing annotations ,  like dimensions ,  center lines ,  hole notes and chamfer notes are all easily added to the document utilizing dedicated ,  manufacturing-centric annotation commands . 
Base views ,  projected views ,  along with section views are all easily established utilizing the drawing environment of Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Inventor .   
Drawing views can be created from any part or assembly .   
Both of these components are used in an industrial frontloader .   
The creation of AutoCAD compliant manufacturing drawings is another major aspect of Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Inventor .   
In this brief tutorial ,  you'll witness the automated drawing documentation abilities of Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Inventor and see how easy it can be to accurately publish your digital prototype drawings using Auto { 3 } d { 4 } esk Product Design Suite . 
The Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Product Design Suite delivers professional quality graphics comparable to magazine pictorials or some of movie blockbusters .   
From initial design modeling ,  all the way through to realistic marketing imagery ,  the AutoDesk Product Design Suite serves as a complete digital prototyping solution ,  allowing you to design ,  simulate and visualize your ideas .   
For this scenario of photo-realistic rendering of frontloader and simulation results are produced for marketing brochure . 
In this scenario ,  graphic images of a simulation analysis are mapped as textures onto frontloader bucket arms .   
Then use move and rotate tools to position the bucket as desired . 
Simply activate the auto key frame and set the time line to the desired time point in the animation . 
To preview the animation ,  simply drag the time line indicator back and forth .   
 The visualizations are created utilizing Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk 3DS MAX Design .   
The ability to virtually create any type of animation or visualization is one of the benefits of creating digital prototypes with the Product Design Suite . 
Compelling proposal renderings are also easy to create with 3DS MAX Design .   
Developing quality proposals or marketing images directly from digital prototype greatly reduces cost and ensures that the images reflect the proposed design . 
3DS MAX Design makes animating a motion of the bucket arm extremely easy .    
Simulating the operation of mechanisms and motorized assemblies digitally helps to investigate and validate how your design will work under real world conditions . 
In this introductory tutorial you will see just one of the scalable simulation analysis capabilities available in the Auto { 1 } d { 2 } esk Product Design Suite .   
This reduces the need for physical prototyping and the associated cost of field failures .   
The  { 1 } UNKNOWN FORCE  { 2 } command will be utilized to determine the force required to move the linkage . 
T { 1 } he Auto { 2 } d { 3 } esk Product Design Suite offers a scalable set of simulation tools that give you the power to optimize and validate product performance early in the design process .    { 4 } 
In this scenario the motion of the cylinder is known ,  but the force to move the bucket is unknown .   
Dynamic simulation is a predictive and behavioral analysis tool designed specifically for mechanism analysis .   
The simulation tools allow you to perform multiple “what if” scenarios and produce the mathematical data necessary to prove your design .   
You will see how dynamic simulation can help you gain a better understanding of your design and how it can help you to make more informed and intelligent design decisions .   
 Designers can perform numerous analysis and mathematical validations on their digital prototypes long before physical prototypes are commissioned .   
In this video ,  you will see how easy it can be to use dynamic simulation to analyze the mechanical linkage of a frontloader .

If you install the service pack by a DVD ,  you will need the DVD for uninstalling the service pack because it needs to find the acadmap . msi during the uninstallation .

In the following illustration ,  the red points represent the points that will be included in the surface when this option is selected : 
Specifies that the  { 1 } Planar Average { 2 }  method is used to identify which points should be filtered out as non-ground points .  
A small  { 1 } Grid Size { 2 }  increases the accuracy of the filter but reduces the speed of the filtering process . 
Specifies the size of the tile areas ,  which are used to divide the selected point cloud data into smaller areas for filtering .  
 { 1 } Smaller areas of tile divided by four and filtered { 2 } 
Specifies the smallest area of the tile that should be filtered . 
 { 1 } Planar Average { 2 } 
This option interpolates new data points to build curves ,  and then filters out the points that are at an elevation above the curves .  
Points that are significantly higher or lower in elevation than other points in the tile are filtered out .  
In the following illustration ,  the blue points represent the points that will be filtered out and the red points represent the points that will be included in the surface when this option is selected : 
Does not apply a filter .  
The following illustrations show an example of a tile area and how it is further subdivided for filtering until the smallest area that is filtered is equal to or slightly larger than the  { 1 } Grid Size { 2 }  . 
 { 1 } Tile divided by four and filtered { 2 } 
The default values for these options are automatically calculated based on the  { 1 } Estimated Mean Distance Between Points { 2 }  value that is displayed on the  { 3 } Point Cloud Selection { 4 }  page of the wizard . 
The default value for the  { 1 } Grid Size { 2 }  is automatically calculated based on the  { 3 } Estimated Mean Distance Between Points { 4 }  value .  
The selected point cloud areas are divided into areas equal to the  { 1 } Tile Size { 2 }  and each tile is filtered to remove non-ground points . 
 { 1 } Tile { 2 } 
Specifies that the  { 1 } Kriging Interpolation { 2 }  method is used to identify which points should be filtered out as non-ground points .  
Each tile is divided into four equal areas and those areas are filtered to remove non-ground points . 
The  { 1 } Tile Size { 2 }  defines the largest area of the point cloud to filter at once .  
The default value for the  { 1 } Tile Size { 2 }  is automatically calculated based on the  { 3 } Estimated Mean Distance Between Points { 4 }  value .  
Each tile is processed individually . 
Depending on how much larger the  { 1 } Tile Size { 2 }  is than the  { 3 } Grid Size { 4 }  ,  each smaller area may be further subdivided into four equal areas and filtered to remove non-ground points . 
This option improves the filtering results but takes more time than the  { 1 } Planar Average { 2 }  method . 
This process of subdividing continues until the areas are equal to or slightly larger than the  { 1 } Grid Size { 2 }  ,  and then those smallest areas are filtered to remove non-ground points . 
These options specify how the point cloud areas are divided into smaller areas for filtering .  
 { 1 } Kriging Interpolation { 2 } 
The  { 1 } Tile Size { 2 }  must be greater than double the  { 3 } Grid Size { 4 }  and it must be less than one hundred times the  { 5 } Grid Size { 6 }  . 
 { 1 } Tile Size { 2 } 
Use this page to filter out points that are not at ground level . 
All points in the selected point cloud areas will be used in the resulting surface .  
 { 1 } Area Subdivision { 2 } 
 { 1 } No Filter { 2 } 
This option is faster than the  { 1 } Kriging Interpolation { 2 }  method ,  but filters out fewer non-ground points . 
The  { 1 } Area Subdivision { 2 }  options are not available when  { 3 } No Filter { 4 }  is selected as the  { 5 } Filter Method { 6 }  . 
This option calculates an average between the elevations of the points and then filters out the points that are at an elevation above the average .

The design is easily oriented utilizing handles that allow you to move or rotate the design as needed . 
These environments control the shadows and reflections displayed on the front loader design . 
Autodesk showcase quickly and easily transforms CAT designs into immersive 3D presentations . 
The easy creation of immersive 3D presentations is just one of the benefits of the digital p { 1 }  { 2 } rototyping workflow available in the Autodesk Product Design Suite .  
Showcase comes equipped with a large library of pre-defined materials . 
They can be easily applied to the front loader . 
The different materials and backgrounds can be saved as alternatives to aid customers in making design decisions . 
 The easiest and most efficient method of creating quality visualizations is utilizing Autodesk Showcase . 
The Autodesk Product Design Suite delivers visualization capabilities that are comparable to magazine pictorials or summer movie blockbusters . 
Quality presentations are an integral part of many design proposals . 
Alias software helps you develop 3D form to achieve a balance between aesthetics and engineering . 
Autodesk Alias allows you to capture and share your ideas in a natural ,  digital-sketching environment . 
The supportive complex surface design for consumer products is just one benefit of the complete digital prototyping solution offered by the Autod { 1 }  { 2 } esk Product Design Suite .

 In this scenario a joystick control handle is being developed for the front loader .  
The Product Design Suite is equipped to develop the most complex surface designs utilizing Autodesk Alias . 
Digital designs come in infinite shapes and forms . 
Many complex shapes require additional surface-centric modeling approaches . 
These sketches are then used to create the surfaces necessary for the design . 
The joystick is then placed on the control panel of the front loader . 
Form ,  function and style all influence a consumer’s choice of products . 
The finished handle design is easily exported to Autodesk inventor and combined with other digital models to complete the joystick design .

External iLogic rules are OK ,  if they are included in the project folder .  
The file format can be : 
Publish a design dialog box
Depending on the size and complexity of the design ,  or how busy the server is ,  it can take a few moments to finish uploading your design .  
IAM  ( using skeleton IPT ,  zipped ) 
IPT designs can include iLogic rules ,  but cannot support methods because methods are stored in a separate file . 
IAM  ( zipped ) 
IPT  ( no external references ) 
This name displays in your catalog for your clients .  
On the Designs tab ,  click New Design .  
While most IPT files can simply be uploaded ,  there are some  { 1 } limitations and restrictions { 2 }  .  
Instead of a skeleton or top-level IAM ,  ETO projects require a top-level or root design ,  a project file ,  and any Inventor files normally required for a full application . 
Setting up an ETO project for use with Configurator 360 is beyond the scope of this document .

Record of charges
If the pool of credits for a contract is empty ,  as an administrator ,  you can still continue to perform all functions .  
Purchase of cloud credits
What is a session?
The duration of a session does not affect the one-credit charge . 
Also ,  sessions run from the Autodesk internal network do not incur a charge . 
The Configurator 360 usage then appears to be charged to that administrator in the reports available on accounts . autodesk . com .  
If there is more than one administrator ,  there is no way to select which administrator is charged . 
To purchase through e-Store ,  go to Subscription Center or accounts . autodesk . com ,  and select buy more cloud credits to a specific contract to purchase .  
cloud credits : purchasing
You cannot have multiple Configurator 360 sessions in multiple tabs or windows of the same browser .  
Specifications and limitations
If you purchase credits through your reseller ,  they can ensure that the credits are added to the relevant contract . 
user charges
When Configurator 360 charges a credit for an end-user session ,  it does so using the credentials of a particular administrator .  
The session  { 1 } ends { 2 }  after the user : 
When the end user opens a design ,  a session  { 1 } starts { 2 }  .  
To find out how to buy more cloud credits ,  click  { 1 } http : //www . autodesk . com/store/configurator-360/cloud-credits { 2 } here { 3 }  . 
However ,  Internet Explorer 10 has a 'New Session' function that allows multiple Configurator 360 sessions from within Internet Explorer .  
Signs out ,  or signs in as a different user . 
Navigates away from the design and goes to another Web page . 
If the user  { 1 } returns { 2 }  to the same design within a short grace period ,  the session continues automatically without an additional charge .  
When the session starts ,  Configurator 360 charges one credit . 
The Configurator 360 iPad app incurs corresponding charges .  
In that case ,  each Configurator 360 session within IE is charged independently . 
Autodesk reserves the right to change these specifications at any time . 
Closes the browser tab or window . 
When do you spend cloud credits?
When the number of cloud-credits in your account goes below a certain threshold ,  all of the administrator users on the account receive a warning message by email .  
However ,  an end user cannot run a configuration session . 
If you sign in as an administrator-user ,  you do not incur a charge to view and configure your own designs .  
Configurator 360 charges 1  ( one )  cloud credit each time an end user opens a design .  
Cloud credits and Configurator 360
Session grace period
According to the Configurator 360 Terms of Service ,  Autodesk reserves the right to enforce more limitations to prevent abuse . 
Is not active in the session for 20 consecutive minutes ,  while still showing the design .  
Opens a new design ,  starting a new session . 
Sessions from each browser are charged independently .  
This selection guides you through the e-Store experience . 
Generally ,  only one session per browser is allowed .  
Common scenarios are using the Back ,  Forward and Refresh buttons on the browser ,  switching between the Product Catalog and the same design ,  and accidental navigation using the wrong browser tab . 
The grace period covers common scenarios .  
The activities that the end user performs within a session ,  such as configuring the design ,  downloading various formats ,  requesting a quote ,  DO NOT incur more charges .  
For general information about Autodesk cloud credits ,  click  { 1 } http : //knowledge . autodesk . com/support/autodesk-360/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Autodesk-360-Cloud-Credits-FAQs . html { 2 } here { 3 }  . 
You can purchase more credits independently ,   { 1 } although you must be careful to purchase them on the relevant contract .  { 2 } 
All products and services  { 1 } purchased on the same contract { 2 }  pool their cloud credits together .  
All  ( other )  administrator functions do not incur cloud-credit charges .  
Many products and services from Autodesk ,  including Configurator 360 ,  consume cloud credits as part of the pricing model .  
Each time you open a design through the iPad app ,  that counts as a session ,  which charges one credit . 
When the end user opens a design ,  a session ,  or end-user session begins .  
The information in this section is on a per-browser basis  ( Internet Explorer ,  Firefox ,  Chrome ,  iPad app )  .

this cursor badge indicates that the object supports multiple scales
Cursor badges for COPY ,  MOVE ,  ROTATE ,  SCALE ,  and ZOOM commands are also turned off . 
When the CURSORBADGE system variable is set to 1 ,  cursor badges used in selection ,  inspection ,  and deletion operations are hidden .  
Turns off isometric drafting .  
By default ,  this command is available on the status bar . 
Turns isometric drafting on or off along with all related settings ,  and specifies the current 2D isometric drafting plane . 
Turns off cursor badges used in selection ,  inspection ,  and deletion .  
Turns on all cursor badges
It also turns off the badges used in the following commands :  COPY ,  MOVE ,  ROTATE ,  SCALE ,  and ZOOM . 
The isometric plane affects the cursor movement only when the snap style is set to Isometric in the Drafting Settings dialog box ,  regardless of whether snap is turned on .  
Orientation of isometric circles
The current isometric plane also determines the orientation of isometric circles created with the Isocircle option of the ELLIPSE command . 
isometric drawing
Ortho directions
Specifies creating top-facing planes ,  defined by the 30-degree and 150-degree axis pair . 
Specifies creating left-facing planes ,  defined by the 90-degree and 150-degree axis pair . 
ISOPLANE involves the following settings and modes when drawing 2D isometric representations of 3D models : 
Specifies creating right-facing planes ,  defined by the 90-degree and 30-degree axis pair . 
Specifies the current plane for 2D isometric drawing . 
The ISOPLANE command has been superseded by the ISODRAFT command .  
Grid orientation and style  ( dotted ) 
Snap orientation
The primary advantage of ISODRAFT is that when it is turned is turned on or off ,  all related settings are automatically changed as well . 
If the snap style is Isometric ,  Ortho mode uses the appropriate axis pair from 30 ,  90 ,  and 150 degrees . 
It is recommended that you choose a predefined hatch  { 1 } pattern { 2 }  that was defined with a non-continuous linetype ,  rather than assigning a non-continuous  { 3 } linetype { 4 }  to a hatch object . 
Hatch objects with non-continuous linetypes assigned to them do not benefit from these enhancements .  
Applies non-continous linetypes to hatch objects  ( legacy behavior )  at the cost of hatch performance
Displays linetypes in predefined and user-defined hatch objects as continuous only ,  regardless of the assigned linetype
Controls how non-continuous linetypes are displayed in hatch objects . 
Pressing F5 ,  CTRL+E ,  or clicking the Isodraft tool on the status bar cycles through the isoplanes . 
A 2D isometric drawing is flat representation of a 3D isometric projection .  
Press F5 or Ctrl+E to cycle through the different isoplanes  ( recommended ) 
Alternatively ,  you can enter  { 1 } isodraft { 2 }  at the Command prompt . 
At the Isodraft prompt in the Command window ,  enter an option
Choose which isoplane orientation that you want to use :  Left ,  Right ,  or Top . 
On the status bar ,  Isodraft button ,  click the dropdown arrow and choose an option
For example ,  you can send all hatches and fills to the back . 
In addition ,  you can specify the draw order of objects by specific type .  
Wipeout objects are intended to provide a blank area for adding text without modifying the objects underneath . 
Several options let you select what object should display and plot in front or behind other objects .  
You can control overlapping objects that cover an area ,  such as objects with thick lineweights ,  wide polylines ,  hatches and fills ,  annotation ,  and images .  
For example ,  the following map includes several different types of overlapping objects .  
Obviously ,  the order in which these objects display and plot is important . 
In general ,  you will want to display and plot annotation objects in front of other objects ,  and hatches and fills behind .  
At the Command prompt ,  enter  { 1 } ellipse { 2 } i { 3 }   ( Isocircle )  . 
Alternatively ,  you can enter  { 1 } isodraft { 2 }  at the Command prompt . 
Create your drawing at actual size consistent with the drawing units that you want to use .  
The only setting that you might need to specify is the one that controls the display style of the units that you plan to use .  
Before you start to draw ,  decide what one drawing unit represents in your drawing . 
For example ,  the Architectural units style displays symbols for feet and inches ,  while the Decimal units style does not . 
The display options are turned off
When you roll over overlapping 2D objects ,  options are available to alert you and let you select between the objects . 
Controls the display options associated with overlapping objects and selection cycling . 
Press Ctrl+W to toggle the current setting on and off . 
Both a badge and the Selection dialog box displays
A badge displays when you hover over objects that overlap
Displays the dotted grid for model space . 
Controls whether the grid displays as dots or lines .

To display the control vertices ,  click  { 1 } Surface tab { 2 } Control Vertices panel { 3 } Show CV { 4 }  . 
If the template specifies a table ,  you are prompted for the insertion point for the table . 
Similarly ,  the symmetric constraint icons indicate whether the symmetry is defined by a point ,  an object ,  or a line : 
Constraint points on objects are similar to object snaps ,  but the locations are limited to endpoints ,  midpoints ,  center points ,  and insertion points .  
When a horizontal or vertical constraint is no longer parallel to the X or Y axis of the  { 1 } current { 2 }  UCS ,  the constraint icons include a blue symbol representing the UCS .  
The icons associated with constraints can include small variations that provide information about how the constraint has been applied . 
Restoring the UCS orientation removes the symbol . 
For example ,  a Fix constraint that is applied to an point rather than the object includes a small circle in the icon : 
A cursor badge displays when you move your cursor over a constrained object
By default ,  a constraint icon displays near the constrained object as shown in the previous illustration :  coincident constraints display as small blue squares ,  and all other constraints display as gray icons

The length and height will be controlled by the number of bins times 12 inches . 
Here we can create a new rule for the size or dimensions we have in the design . 
Notice that the patterned features in the design have been renamed in the browser which makes them easier to find .  
We can also control other dimensions that are used for the number instances in patterns ,  such as the rows and columns for the bins ,  as well as the number of shelves .   
In the manage tab you will find the iLogic browser .   
Make edit boxes read only ,  set minimum and maximum values ,  exclude parameters ,  even change the display name . 
Back in the parameters dialog we’re going to use pull-downs where the number of bins controls the Height and Length of the storage unit . 
Now that we understand how to include parameters in the Configurator 360 product catalog .   
There are additional options after the model has been uploaded to your Configurator 360 product catalog .   
Let’s talk about adding rules for them using the iLogic browser . 
Dimensions can also be renamed making it easier to find the variables you’re looking for . 
In the next one minute video we’ll talk about adding checkboxes and additional options in iLogic . 
Back in the parameters dialog it’s always a good idea to test these rules before uploading the model . 
Welcome to the first of a video series in the experience of using Configurator 360 .   
In the next one minute video we will talk more about how these parameters are propagated to the form . 
During this one minute video we’ll talk about the online interface to get started . 
Under Else we’re simply going to reverse the suppression state of each feature . 
If the bin size is set as small then make the depth parameter equal to 12 inches .   
Both of these parameters will be controlled by an if ,  then ,  else logic statement .   
You can begin uploading your new models in the designs tab .   
Simply click on the New Designs button and upload part or assembly documents .   
Let’s begin by logging into configurator 360 .   
The parameters that you see on the left are the configurable values and features that you choose in Inventor .   
Once the file is uploaded it can be viewed by authorized users .    
The capabilities in the other tabs enable you to change settings for the look and feel of your page ,  downloadable files ,  settings for quotes ,  and cloud credit usage . 
There are also settings for client permissions and a tab for a list of requested quotes . 
The home tab contains online help for answering all your questions about uploading new designs . 
Browse for the file and upload it to your catalog . 
Else set the depth to 18 inches . 
Now that we have a basic understanding of iLogic in Inventor ,  let’s continue that discussion with other features that are available .   
Once the design has been uploaded to your catalog in Configurator 360 we can see what our parameters look like .   
We have one feature for the legs and four of them that make up the caster .   
In the next statement we’re going to decide on the casters .   
While we’re still in Inventor we can test these rules in the parameters dialog .   
You will notice the pulldown for the size of the bins and a checkbox for using casters or legs . 
They can be edited in a number of different ways such as edit boxes ,  pull-downs ,  or checkboxes . 
Then do the following .   
Decide whether it’s turned on or off using true or false .   
In the parameters dialog we’ll add additional { 1 }   { 2 } variables for the bin size which is either small or large as well as a true or false option for casters . 
Stay tuned for more short videos on advanced techniques using iLogic in Inventor . 
Be sure to test as many variables as possible to ensure that the design intent is working properly . 
Then we can add a rule for those two user parameters .   
Right click on a feature from the browser and capture its current state .   
If the casters parameter is set to false .   
Notice that the depth of the storage unit is driven by a parameter named depth .   
We’ll use a default value of 48 inches .   
With the model loaded in Inventor we can take a closer look at the dimensions that are used to drive our design . 
Simply add a user parameter and give it a name .   
Create a list of values to choose from and the user parameter automatically changes to a pull-down instead of an edit box . 
This list is created from the parameters dialog . 
Back in the Configurator 360 online interface ,  you will see the three user parameters are shown in the form when the model is uploaded .   
Now that we know how to upload the models to Configurator 360 ,  let’s talk about how the form gets propagated with parameters . 
In the next one minute video we’ll include the use of iLogic to establish rules for user parameters . 
When editing dimensions you will find an option to link it to a list to choose from .   
Then we can link an existing model dimension to that variable .   
Let’s take it a step further and make the length a multi-value option .   
Watch how the model updates accordingly .   
Let’s to the same thing for the length .   
Rather than selecting all the files during upload ,  you can select a zip file that contains the assembly and all dependent sub-assemblies and parts . 
Let’s add another parameter for the price of the product based on the customer’s choices . 
Once the design has been uploaded to Configurator 360 ,  we can see that the total price is updated instantly when the caster box is checked . 
Here you can see a beer brewing system with options for up to 3 tiers and two different sizes of kettles .   
If the parameter Casters equals true ,  then CasterPrice equals 50 .   
At the bottom ,  Total Price is equal to dollar sign in quotes ,  ampersand ,  then add up all the variables for each choice that impacts the price of the final assembly . 
Simply find the parameters for each part in the browser and specify the value for a 10 gallon kettle and a 20 gallon . 
Now that we have created some parameters for the style and size of our assembly .   
We only have two options for the size .   
In here we can create If ,  Then ,  Else logic statements for the choices in the catalog .   
In the parameters dialog we can test the two different kettle sizes . 
Here you can see inside the parameters dialog .   
In the previous videos we spoke about uploading parts to Configurator 360 .   
Or use Else If when there are more than two options to choose from . 
We’ll simply change the values of the parameters under else .   
Uploading assemblies into your Configurator 360 catalog looks a little different than parts .   
Watch the next video for including the retail price of your uploaded products in your catalog . 
Let’s talk about driving parameters of parts from the assembly level and upload that to our catalog . 
Let’s include the option for casters . 
We can accomplish this in rules established in the iLogic browser .   
Using an if ,  then ,  else logic statement we can determine the length parameters of the side tubes ,  angle supports ,  and boil over tray .   
We have established the price based on the number of tiers ,  size of the kettle ,  and the burner .   
Be sure to watch the next video on changing the appearance of your models in your Configurator 360 catalog . 
Once the file is uploaded we can see our options for the size of the beer brewing system . 
Else the CasterPrice is zero . 
I’ve already created a rule for pricing in the iLogic browser .   
The length of each tube needs to change at the part level .

Keep in mind that the link from AutoCAD Factory to Navisworks Factory is one-way only .  
However ,  the link between AutoCAD Factory and Inventor Factory is bi-directional . 
The { 1 }  Connector Snap Tolerance { 2 }  value in the  { 3 } Factory Options { 4 }  dialog box defines the distance between two connectors to enable snapping .  
Next ,  move your cursor with the attached asset in close proximity to the asset connector with which you wish to connect . 
This action displays all unconsumed connectors  ( appearing as green dots )  in the layout .   { 1 } 
Connected assets move together as one component .  
Select the first connector on the asset you wish to connect .  
Unconsumed connectors
FACT_CSNAP command
Click  { 1 } Factory { 2 }  tab >  { 3 } Utilities { 4 }  panel >  { 5 } Connect { 6 }  .  
You can both display and connect unconsumed connectors together using the  { 1 } Connect { 2 }  command .   { 3 } 
Connectors Enabled
The connector dot is now attached to your cursor . 
The connectors on these assets are said to be  { 1 } unconsumed { 2 }  .  
You can also toggle this setting on/off from the command line using the  { 1 } FACT_CSNAP { 2 }  command .  
If you wish to move them separately from one another ,  simply click  { 1 } Factory { 2 }  tab >  { 3 } Utilities { 4 }  panel >  { 5 } Connectors Disabled { 6 }  . 
Click to connect the two assets . 
An example of several assets with unconsumed connectors is shown below .  
An additional way to disable connectors is to deactivate the  { 1 } Snap to Connector during placement and repositioning { 2 }  check box on the  { 3 } Factory Assets { 4 }  tab in the  { 5 } Options { 6 }  dialog box .  
To Connect Two Placed Assets
Connector Disabled
There may be occasions when two assets with defined connectors exist in a factory layout but are not connected .  
Once you have selected your model ,  a green checkmark appears in the  { 1 } 3D Assoc . 
Define Orientation
 { 1 }  column in the  { 2 } Block Browser { 3 }  dialog to confirm the successful association . 
On the  { 1 } Asset Builder { 2 }  tab ,  in the  { 3 } Block { 4 }  panel ,  click  { 5 } Edit Block { 6 }  to open the AutoCAD  { 7 } Block Authoring { 8 }  palette . 
Validate 3D Model
Observe from the image below that the orientation of the model does not match the orientation of the block .  { 1 }

If you wish to move them separately from one another ,  deactivate the  { 1 } Snap to Connector during placement and repositioning { 2 }  check box on the  { 3 } Factory Assets { 4 }  tab in the  { 5 } Options { 6 }  dialog box . 
Factory Design Utilities :  placing assets with connectors
The green dots at the ends of each asset indicate the connector locations as defined in Inventor Factory .  { 1 } 
This setting can also be toggled on/off from the command line using the  { 1 }  FACT_CSNAP { 2 }  command . 
Assets can be defined with one or more connectors in Inventor Factory and then connected together when placed in the AutoCAD Factory layout . 
It is occasionally necessary to connect one asset to another in a linear fashion .  
Connected assets move together as one component .  
The two assets snap together as shown below .  { 1 } 
Placing Assets with Connectors
Simply move the asset to be connected so that its green connector dot is in close proximity with the connector dot on the other asset .  
If the Block Browser palette is off ,  a message displays in the Block Preview panel that reads :  "Please double-click a block to enter the Asset Builder environment . "

If an asset is published in AutoCAD and has no associated 3D model ,  the asset is synced to Navisworks with no 3D model . 
The Sync Navisworks command invokes the following behaviors . 
A 2D layout is synced to Navisworks as a whole on the floor . 
If an asset is published from Inventor ,  the asset is synced to Navisworks with the Inventor model . 
To Use the Sync Navisworks Command
The Sync Navisworks command appears in the Suites Workflows panel . 
If an asset has an associated 3D model ,  the asset is synced to Navisworks with the 3D model . 
Here is how it works : 
Sync Navisworks
To Use Define Orientation Tools
To Associate a 3D Model with a 2D Drawing
To Use the 3D Move Command
Here is how it works : 
The  { 1 } Delete { 2 }  button deletes the selected property from the  { 3 } Properties list { 4 }  .  { 5 }

To Use the 3D Rotate Command
The general user workflow for this procedure is as follows : 
Add asset properties such as Title ,  Company ,  Author ,  etc . 
In addition ,  the object may have been created with a different CAD system and so be in a different file format .  
Define the model orientation
Select the 2D block
Validate the 3D model
There may be occasions when you have a 2D AutoCAD block representing a component in your factory layout ,  but the block is not a defined factory asset .  
Once those tasks are completed ,  the asset may be published as a local asset or to the Cloud .  
The 3D representation of the object then appears when the AutoCAD layout is synced to either Inventor Factory or Navisworks Factory . 
Associate the 3D model to the block
Building and Publishing an Asset
Make any additional edits to the block ,  if required
The  { 1 } Asset Builder { 2 }  environment allows you to create an AutoCAD Factory asset of the block ,  associate a 3D object to it ,  and define its orientation .  
To prevent this behavior ,  select  { 1 } Append File { 2 }  in the Navisworks  { 3 } Options Editor { 4 }  dialog and activate the  { 5 } Start Transform command after appending file { 6 }  check box shown below :  { 7 } 
When active ,  zoom and transform commands are run automatically after the file is appended . 
To open the  { 1 } Options Editor { 2 }  ,  right-click in the Navisworks graphics window and select  { 3 } Global Options { 4 }  from the pop-up context window . 
Factory Options - Append File
Normally ,  when a file is opened in Navisworks running from the Factory Design Suite ,  the last file in the  { 1 } Selection Tree { 2 }  is automatically selected and the view is zoomed to the extents of that file .  
You can also quickly open the  { 1 } Options Editor { 2 }  dialog by pressing function key  { 3 } F12 .  { 4 } 
If the last file has both very large and small models in the layout ,  the view zooms out so much that the small models are often not visible . 
When inactive ,  zoom and transform commands do not run after the file is appended . 
Append File
There are several things to keep in mind regarding this setting : 
You can now synchronize 2D drawings to 3D models .

About Syncing an AutoCAD Layout to Navisworks
If assets in the layout are Inventor-published with an Inventor 3D model ,  the Inventor model is shown in Navisworks . 
When making factory layouts ,  equipment vendors often provide both 2D drawings and 3D models of assets .  
Now you can easily leverage those 3D models in factory layout work ,  thanks to the variety of supported CAD file formats associated with the Sync Navisworks command . 
If 2D assets in the layout are associated with 3D models ,  the 3D models will display in Navisworks .
